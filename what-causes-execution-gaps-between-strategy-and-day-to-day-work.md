### Short Answer

Execution gaps occur when strategy remains at the conceptual level without operational translation, when incentive structures reward behaviors that conflict with strategic priorities, and when leaders mistake agreement for alignment. Most execution gaps stem from organizational systems that haven't adapted to the new strategy, not from poor communication or lack of commitment.

### Why This Matters

Organizations waste significant resources on strategies that never translate into changed behavior. The problem isn't that people don't understand the strategy - it's that daily decision-making criteria, resource allocation processes, and incentive structures still reflect the old strategy.

### The Root Causes

**1. Strategy Stays Aspirational, Not Operational**

Leaders communicate vision and direction but don't translate strategy into specific decision-making criteria.

"We're going enterprise-first" is aspirational. "When choosing between enterprise and SMB features, we build enterprise first - even if SMB features would generate faster revenue" is operational.

Without operational translation, everyone interprets strategy differently based on their functional perspective.

**2. Incentive Structures Reward Old Behavior**

Strategy changes. Comp plans don't. OKRs don't. Promotion criteria don't.

When your VP of Sales is bonused on total deals closed (not enterprise deals), she'll rationally prioritize whatever closes fastest - even if strategy says "enterprise-first."

People do what they're measured on, not what was said in a strategy meeting.

**3. Agreement Gets Mistaken for Alignment**

Leaders communicate strategy. Everyone nods. Nobody objects.

Leaders interpret this as alignment and move forward.

But nodding doesn't mean people know how to translate strategy into different daily decisions. Agreement on direction doesn't guarantee consistent execution across functions.

**4. Resource Allocation Doesn't Shift**

If strategy shifts from SMB to enterprise, resource allocation should shift dramatically: hiring plans, budget distribution, time allocation, tool investments.

Most organizations split resources "fairly" across old and new priorities, which means neither gets adequately resourced. Execution stalls because resources don't match stated strategy.

**5. Decision Rights Remain Unclear**

Strategy changes what matters. But if decision rights don't change, the wrong people are making critical calls - or everyone's escalating decisions that should be made at lower levels.

"Enterprise-first" means Sales needs different autonomy to discount, Product needs different authority to deprioritize features, and CS needs different latitude to allocate support resources.

### What Good Execution Looks Like

Organizations that successfully translate strategy into execution:

- **Make strategy operational:** Translate vision into specific decision-making criteria, prioritization rules, and trade-off frameworks that guide daily work.

- **Align incentives with strategy:** Update comp plans, OKRs, and promotion criteria to reward strategic behavior before launching the strategy.

- **Test for understanding, not agreement:** After communicating strategy, leaders ask "what will you do differently?" and surface misunderstandings immediately.

- **Shift resources to match strategy:** Budget, hiring, and time allocation visibly shift toward strategic priorities within weeks, not quarters.

- **Update decision rights:** Clarify who makes which decisions differently based on strategic priorities, reducing escalation and increasing execution speed.

### What To Do Next

**1. Make your strategy operational**

For each strategic priority, define:
- What specific behaviors should change?
- What trade-offs should be made differently?
- What decision-making criteria should guide choices?
- What resource allocation should shift?

**2. Map incentive conflicts**

List every metric your leadership team is measured on. For each, ask: "Does achieving this metric reinforce our strategy or conflict with it?"

Fix incentive conflicts before communicating the strategy.

**3. Test for execution understanding**

Don't ask "do you agree with our strategy?"

Ask "based on this strategy, what will you do differently this quarter?" Misalignment surfaces immediately.

**4. Separate diagnosis from action**

Don't assume you know where execution gaps exist. Use structured diagnostic inquiry to surface where strategy breaks down between leadership and frontline execution.
