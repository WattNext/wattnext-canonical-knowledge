# Contributing to WattNext Knowledge Base

Thank you for your interest in improving this organizational intelligence knowledge base.

## What We Accept

We welcome contributions that improve accuracy, clarity, and usefulness:

### ✅ Accepted Contributions

- **Factual corrections** - Fix errors in research citations, statistics, or organizational theory
- **Clarity improvements** - Improve explanation quality, fix confusing wording, add examples
- **Research additions** - Add relevant academic citations or behavioral research
- **Real-world examples** - Anonymized case studies that illustrate patterns (with permission)
- **Broken link fixes** - Update dead links or outdated references
- **Formatting fixes** - Improve markdown formatting, fix typos, improve structure

### ❌ Not Accepted

- **Generic management advice** - "10 tips for better leadership" style content
- **Promotional content** - Vendor pitches, consultant selling, product placement
- **Theoretical frameworks without behavioral grounding** - Needs research backing
- **Personal anecdotes without pattern documentation** - Individual stories vs systemic patterns
- **Changes to proprietary methodology** - Scoring system (0.0-2.0) is not disclosed

## How To Contribute

### For Small Changes (typos, broken links, minor clarifications)

1. **Open an issue** describing the correction needed
2. **Include specific reference** - Quote the text that needs fixing
3. **Provide correction** - What should it say instead?
4. **Cite source** if adding research or data

We'll review and merge quickly if appropriate.

### For Larger Changes (new examples, substantial edits, research additions)

1. **Open an issue first** describing the proposed change
2. **Wait for feedback** before investing time in writing
3. **Provide evidence** - Link to research, cite behavioral studies, document patterns
4. **Explain rationale** - Why does this improve the knowledge base?

We'll discuss approach before you invest significant effort.

### For New Questions or Dimensions

We're not currently accepting new questions or dimensions. The 157 questions map to our diagnostic framework (134 indicators across 13 dimensions).

If you believe a critical pattern is missing, open an issue describing:
- What organizational pattern is missing
- Why it matters for organizational functioning
- How it connects to existing dimensions
- Research backing the importance

We'll consider additions carefully.

## Writing Standards

If contributing content, follow these guidelines:

### Voice & Tone
- **Sharp, conversational** - Sound human, not corporate
- **Behavioral focus** - Observable patterns, not abstract theory
- **System-level** - Structural causes, not individual blame
- **Evidence-backed** - Research citations, not opinions

### Structure
- **Start with "why this matters"** - Practical relevance first
- **Behavioral examples** - Show what patterns look like in practice
- **System-level fixes** - Address structural causes, not just symptoms
- **Related content links** - Connect to other relevant questions

### What To Avoid
- **HR jargon** - "synergy," "stakeholder engagement," "best practices"
- **Consultant-speak** - "operationalize," "leverage," "strategic imperatives"
- **Motivational language** - "be the change," "embrace transformation"
- **Vague advice** - "communicate better," "build trust," "improve culture"

### Research Citations
When adding research or data:
- **Include full citation** - Author, year, publication, link if available
- **Quote accurately** - Don't misrepresent findings
- **Provide context** - Sample size, study design, limitations
- **Link to source** when possible

Format: (Author, Publication, Year)

Example: "Organizations with strong strategic alignment are 70% more likely to be top-quartile performers (McKinsey, 2024)"

## Review Process

All contributions go through review:

1. **Initial triage** - Is this appropriate for the knowledge base?
2. **Accuracy check** - Are claims supported by evidence?
3. **Voice check** - Does it match our behavioral, system-level approach?
4. **Integration check** - How does it fit with existing content?

We'll provide feedback if changes are needed before merging.
