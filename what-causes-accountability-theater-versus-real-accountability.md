What causes accountability theater versus real accountability?

**Slug:** `what-causes-accountability-theater-versus-real-accountability`

**Short Answer:** Accountability theater happens when **roles are documented but not operational**. RACI charts exist, but real decisions happen in hallways. Actual ownership determined by who escalates fastest. Real accountability means decision rights are used in practice, updated when reality diverges, and consistently respected across the organization.
