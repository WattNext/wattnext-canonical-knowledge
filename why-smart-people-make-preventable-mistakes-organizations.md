Why do smart people keep making preventable mistakes in organizations?

**Featured Snippet Potential:** Very High

### Short Answer

Smart people make preventable mistakes not because they're careless, but because **the decision-making infrastructure is broken**. When decision rights are unclear, information doesn't flow to decision-makers, decisions happen at the wrong organizational level, and no shared frameworks exist, even brilliant people make choices that seem right with the information they have - until those decisions collide with reality weeks or months later. The problem isn't talent. It's the absence of systems that govern who decides what, with what information, using which criteria.

### Why This Matters

**61% of executives say poor decision-making is the single biggest barrier to executing strategy** (McKinsey Global Survey, 2024). But most attribute this to insufficient talent or unclear strategy, not broken decision-making infrastructure.

The cost is invisible at first. Product spends six months building a feature Sales never needed. Marketing launches campaigns targeting the wrong buyers. Engineering makes architectural decisions that conflict with strategic direction. Nobody made a "dumb" choice - they all made decisions that seemed completely reasonable with the information they had.

Organizations waste enormous resources not because people are incompetent, but because the infrastructure to support good decisions doesn't exist.

### The Mechanism Behind Preventable Mistakes

**1. Unclear Decision Rights Create Political Negotiation**

Competitive threat emerges. Who decides how to respond?

Product thinks they own product decisions. Engineering thinks technical feasibility gives them decision authority. Sales thinks customer impact makes it their call.

Three weeks of meetings to establish who decides. Eventually CEO makes the call in a hallway conversation without involving Engineering. The solution is technically infeasible.

Nobody was stupid. The system just never clarified who decides what.

**What should exist:**

Explicit decision rights: "Product VP owns competitive response decisions. Engineering provides technical feasibility input. Sales provides customer impact data. Final decision: Product VP."

When decision rights are explicit, the three-week political negotiation disappears.

**2. Information Asymmetry Creates Blind Decisions**

Marketing launches expensive campaign targeting enterprise buyers.

Same week, Sales shifts focus to mid-market because enterprise deals are taking too long to close.

Nobody told Marketing.

Six weeks and $80K later, someone notices the campaign is targeting the wrong audience. Zero pipeline generated.

Both decisions were rational:
- Marketing's decision: "We need more enterprise pipeline, let's run enterprise campaign"
- Sales's decision: "Enterprise deals take 18 months, we need revenue this quarter, focus on mid-market"

Both teams made the best decision with the information they had. But critical information (Sales's strategic shift) never reached Marketing before they committed resources.

**What should exist:**

Information flow systems that ensure Sales's strategic shift reaches Marketing before Marketing commits to campaign spend.

**3. Wrong-Level Decisions Create Catastrophe or Bottlenecks**

Pattern A: Junior PM needs to decide which bug to fix. Escalates to Director. Director escalates to VP because "this affects customer experience." VP pulls in CEO.

CEO spends 45 minutes deciding bug prioritization.

Pattern B: Director decides to deprecate feature that 30% of enterprise customers rely on. Doesn't escalate to VP.

VP discovers this when enterprise customer calls, furious.

Both patterns stem from unclear elevation criteria. Nobody knows which decisions should be made at which level.

**What should exist:**

Explicit elevation criteria:
- Reversible decisions with limited blast radius: Lowest competent level
- Irreversible decisions or high-impact ones: Level with full context and accountability

**4. No Shared Frameworks Create Inconsistent Decisions**

Three PMs evaluating features use different criteria:

PM 1: Prioritizes features customers are loudest about
PM 2: Prioritizes features that are technically easiest
PM 3: Prioritizes features aligned with strategic roadmap

All three think they're doing the right thing. But inconsistency fragments execution.

**What should exist:**

Shared decision framework: "Features evaluated on: strategic alignment (40%), customer impact (30%), effort (30%). Minimum threshold on all three dimensions to proceed."

Now disagreement is about the inputs, not the framework.

### How This Shows Up in Practice

**Scenario: Product builds the wrong feature**

Product team builds Feature A based on Sales's request for "better reporting."

Sales meant "actionable intelligence presented clearly." Product heard "enterprise-grade dashboards."

Six months of work. Feature ships. Sales is furious: "This isn't what we meant at all."

**What went wrong:**

Not stupidity. Not carelessness. Decision-making infrastructure failures:
- No shared definition of "better reporting"
- No process to validate interpretation before six-month commitment
- No checkpoints to surface misalignment before shipping

**What would have prevented this:**

- Shared framework defining what "better" means (criteria: actionability, speed to insight, ease of use)
- Decision checkpoint at 2 weeks: "Here's what we think you meant. Confirm before we build."
- Regular information exchange ensuring Product and Sales stay aligned

### Why Leaders Miss This

Leaders experience good decision-making at their level and assume it exists everywhere.

But decision-making quality often varies by altitude:
- Executive team: Excellent decision hygiene
- Middle management: Chaos

Leaders don't see:
- The hundreds of decisions escalated unnecessarily because people fear making the wrong call
- The decisions delayed indefinitely because nobody's clear who decides
- The decisions made badly three levels down that create execution problems weeks later

Additionally, good outcomes can mask bad process. You made the right call despite terrible information flow or unclear ownership. You got lucky. But the system didn't improve.

### Fixing the Infrastructure

**1. Make decision rights explicit**

For every recurring decision type, clarify:
- Who decides
- Who provides input
- Who gets informed
- What constitutes this type of decision

Example:
- "Product roadmap prioritization: Director decides. PM provides feature analysis. Engineering provides effort estimates. Sales provides customer impact data. VP informed after decision."

**2. Design information flow intentionally**

Identify critical information for each decision type. Ensure it reaches decision-makers before decisions, not after.

Example:
- "Before roadmap planning, Product receives: competitive intelligence from Sales, churn analysis from CS, strategic priorities from leadership."

**3. Establish elevation criteria**

Define which decisions happen at which level based on reversibility and impact, not based on fear or politics.

Example:
- Reversible, low impact: Lowest competent level
- Reversible, high impact: Director level with VP informed
- Irreversible, any impact: VP level with exec team informed

**4. Create shared frameworks**

For recurring decision types, establish common evaluation criteria so decisions are consistent even when different people make them.

Example:
- "Feature prioritization: Strategic alignment (40%), customer impact (30%), effort (30%). Score on 1-10 scale. Minimum 6 on all dimensions to proceed."
