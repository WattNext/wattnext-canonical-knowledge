### Short Answer

The gap between stated and lived values is created when leadership designs values based on aspiration but reinforces behavior based on pressure, convenience, and short-term results. Stated values reflect what leadership wants to be true. Lived values reflect what actually gets rewarded, punished, and tolerated when values conflict with quarterly targets, political convenience, or operational pressure. The gap persists because leadership experiences filtered signals that hide the contradiction.

### Why This Matters

Every organization has this gap to some degree. The question is: How wide is it?

**When the gap is narrow:** Stated values and lived values mostly align. Culture feels authentic. People trust leadership.

**When the gap is wide:** Stated values become cynical jokes. People stop believing anything leadership says. Best performers leave for places where stated and lived actually match.

### How The Gap Forms

**Phase 1: Values are created aspirationally**

Leadership sits in offsite. Designs values based on:
- What kind of company they want to be
- What will attract talent
- What sounds good to customers and investors

Values: Innovation. Integrity. Customer-First. Collaboration.

These aren't lies. Leadership genuinely wants these to be true.

But they're aspirational. Not yet operational.

**Phase 2: Pressure reveals true priorities**

Quarter is tough. Revenue at risk. Investors pushing.

Decisions get made under pressure:
- Sales asks to mislead customer about capabilities to close deal → Leadership approves it
- Product wants to fix customer pain, Sales wants demo feature → Sales wins
- Engineer spots security issue before launch → "Ship anyway, we'll fix it later"

What got rewarded: Hitting the number. Looking good. Moving fast.

What got punished: Integrity. Customer-first. Quality.

**Phase 3: Teams learn lived values**

Everyone watching those decisions learns the real priorities:
- "Integrity" means integrity until results are at risk
- "Customer-first" means customer-first unless it slows us down
- "Quality" means quality unless deadlines are tight

Stated values: Still on the wall, still in onboarding, still mentioned in all-hands.

Lived values: What actually governs behavior.

The gap is now established.

**Phase 4: Gap becomes self-reinforcing**

People who thrive in the lived culture stay and get promoted.

People who believed the stated values leave or adapt.

New hires quickly learn to ignore stated values and follow lived values.

Leadership still talks about stated values. But everyone knows they're not real.

### Why The Gap Persists

**1. Leadership doesn't see the gap**

Signal loss strips away the contradictions before they reach executives.

Leadership hears: "We hit the target."

Teams experience: "We hit the target by violating every stated value."

Leadership thinks values are working. Teams know they're theater.

**2. Each violation seems justified**

"We had to mislead that customer - we needed the quarter."

"We had to ship with bugs - the deadline was critical."

"We had to reward the territorial manager - they hit their numbers."

Each individual decision seems rational. The pattern is what destroys culture.

**3. Short-term rewards contradict long-term values**

Stated values are long-term: "Build sustainable customer trust."

Short-term pressure is immediate: "Close this deal now."

When they conflict, short-term wins. Every time.

**4. Nobody wants to be the person who says it**

Everyone sees the gap. Nobody feels safe naming it publicly.

"Our stated values are lies" is career-limiting honesty.

So the gap persists in plain sight, with everyone quietly knowing but nobody saying.

### The Cost

**Cynicism replaces trust:**

When people learn stated values are theater, they stop believing anything leadership says.

Next value leadership announces? Eye rolls. Quiet cynicism.

**Best people leave:**

High performers joined because they believed your values. They discover the gap. They leave for places where stated and lived actually align.

**Values become constraints you route around:**

Instead of values guiding behavior, they become obstacles to ignore.

"How do we hit this target without obviously violating our stated values?" becomes the question.

**Compliance replaces commitment:**

People do what they're told. They don't bring discretionary effort. Because bringing your best self to work requires believing the place you work actually lives its values.

### What To Do

**1. Audit where values break under pressure**

List your stated values. For each one, ask:

"Last time this value conflicted with hitting a number, what happened?"

If the value got sacrificed, that's your real priority. Not the stated value.

**2. Make values operational, not aspirational**

Don't say "integrity." Say: "We don't mislead customers about capabilities, even to close deals. If that costs us this quarter, we accept that cost."

Operational values create clear decision-making criteria.

Aspirational values create confusion and gap.

**3. Reward values adherence even when costly**

Someone held the line on a value even though it cost them their target.

Reward them. Publicly. Promote them.

Show the organization: Living the values gets rewarded even when it's expensive.

**4. Name the gap when you see it**

When a decision contradicts stated values, name it:

"This decision conflicts with our integrity value. I'm choosing to do it anyway for X reason. I want everyone to know I see the contradiction."

Naming it doesn't eliminate the gap. But it prevents the cynicism that comes from pretending the gap doesn't exist.

**5. Reduce stated values to what you'll actually hold**

If you have 8 stated values but only 3 survive under pressure, reduce to 3.

Better to have 3 authentic values than 8 aspirational ones that breed cynicism.
