### Short Answer

Determine who makes which decisions by **mapping decision types to decision rights based on information access, reversibility, impact, and accountability**. Start by cataloging recurring decision types (roadmap prioritization, hiring, budget allocation, strategic pivots). For each type, identify: (1) who has the information needed to decide well, (2) whether the decision is reversible or irreversible, (3) the potential impact radius, and (4) who can be held accountable for outcomes. Assign decision rights to the lowest organizational level that satisfies all four criteria.

### Why This Matters

**Decision-making eats 37% of the average manager's time** (Bain & Company). But most of that time isn't spent actually deciding - it's spent figuring out who decides and negotiating with people who think they should have decided.

When decision rights are unclear, every decision becomes a political process. People either escalate everything (to avoid blame) or make decisions beyond their scope (creating catastrophic mistakes).

Clear decision rights eliminate the political negotiation. Decisions happen faster, at the right level, with the right information.

### The Four-Criteria Framework

**Criterion 1: Information Access**

Who has the information needed to make this decision well?

Example: Feature prioritization decision

Who has relevant information:
- PM: Deep understanding of customer needs and competitive landscape
- Engineering: Technical feasibility and effort estimates
- Sales: Revenue impact and customer urgency
- Leadership: Strategic priorities

In this case, PM has most information, but needs input from Engineering, Sales, and Leadership.

Decision right: PM decides, with required input from Engineering, Sales, Leadership.

**Criterion 2: Reversibility**

Can this decision be easily undone?

Reversible decisions (can be changed quickly at low cost):
- Change button color
- Update email copy
- Adjust meeting cadence
- Resequence features in sprint

Irreversible decisions (cannot be easily undone):
- Acquire company
- Deprecate major product feature
- Restructure organization
- Change pricing model

**Rule:** Reversible decisions should be made at the lowest competent level. Irreversible decisions require higher elevation and more scrutiny.

**Criterion 3: Impact Radius**

How many people, teams, or customers does this decision affect?

Limited impact: Affects one team or small customer subset
→ Can be decided at team level

Medium impact: Affects multiple teams or significant customer segment
→ Requires director or VP level

High impact: Affects entire organization or all customers
→ Requires executive level

Example:
- Bug fix affecting 50 users: PM decides
- Feature affecting 30% of customers: Director decides with VP informed
- Pricing change affecting all customers: VP decides with CEO approval

**Criterion 4: Accountability**

Who will be held accountable for the outcome of this decision?

The decision right should rest with whoever bears accountability.

If VP of Product is accountable for roadmap outcomes, VP of Product should decide roadmap prioritization (or explicitly delegate with clear boundaries).

If Director is accountable for team delivery, Director should decide team staffing and resourcing (within budget constraints).

Accountability without decision rights creates responsibility without authority. Decision rights without accountability creates reckless decision-making.

### The Decision Rights Matrix

Map decision types to decision rights:

**Level 1: Individual Contributor**
- Decisions: How to execute assigned work, sequencing of tasks, tooling choices within team standards
- Criteria: Reversible, limited impact, IC has best information, IC accountable for delivery

**Level 2: Manager**
- Decisions: Team priorities within strategic direction, assignment of work, routine hiring within budget
- Criteria: Reversible or reversible with coordination, team-level impact, manager has team context, manager accountable for team outcomes

**Level 3: Director**
- Decisions: Department strategy within company direction, cross-team prioritization, resource allocation across teams
- Criteria: Some irreversible, department-level impact, director has cross-team view, director accountable for department outcomes

**Level 4: VP**
- Decisions: Functional strategy, major feature bets, significant resource allocation, key hiring
- Criteria: Often irreversible, cross-functional impact, VP has functional context, VP accountable to exec team

**Level 5: Executive/CEO**
- Decisions: Company strategy, M&A, major organizational changes, board-level commitments
- Criteria: Irreversible, company-wide impact, exec has full context, exec accountable to board

### Common Decision Types and Rights

**Product Decisions:**
- Bug prioritization within sprint: PM decides
- Feature sequencing: PM decides with engineering input
- Roadmap prioritization within strategic themes: Director decides
- Major feature bets: VP decides
- Strategic product direction: VP decides with CEO approval

**Hiring Decisions:**
- Backfill for existing role within budget: Manager decides
- New role within team budget: Director decides
- New role requiring budget increase: VP decides
- Executive hire: CEO decides

**Budget Decisions:**
- Spending within approved budget: Manager decides
- Budget reallocation within department: Director decides
- Budget increase request: VP decides
- Significant budget expansion: CEO decides with board approval

**Strategic Decisions:**
- Tactical execution within strategy: Manager decides
- Department strategy within company direction: Director decides
- Functional strategy: VP decides
- Company strategy: CEO decides with board input

### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Catalog recurring decision types**

List the 20-30 most common important decisions in your organization:
- Product roadmap prioritization
- Feature scope decisions
- Hiring decisions
- Budget allocation
- Go-to-market strategy
- Customer escalations
- Vendor selection
- Process changes

**Step 2: Apply the four criteria**

For each decision type, evaluate:
- Who has the information to decide well?
- Is it reversible or irreversible?
- What's the impact radius?
- Who bears accountability?

**Step 3: Assign decision rights**

Based on criteria, assign:
- Decision-maker (D): Who makes the final call
- Required input (R): Who must be consulted before deciding
- Optional input (O): Who can provide input if decision-maker seeks it
- Informed (I): Who gets told after the decision is made

Example:
"Feature prioritization decisions: PM decides (D), Engineering required input on effort (R), Sales required input on customer impact (R), Leadership optional input on strategy alignment (O), Marketing informed (I)"

**Step 4: Document and communicate**

Create a decision rights matrix accessible to everyone. For each decision type:
- Clear description of what constitutes this decision
- Who decides (D)
- Who provides required input (R)
- Who can provide optional input (O)
- Who gets informed (I)
- Example scenarios to clarify boundaries

**Step 5: Test and refine**

When decision-making confusion occurs, update the matrix. Treat it as a living document that evolves as the organization learns.

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Making decision rights too vague**

Bad: "Product VP owns product decisions"

Better: "Product VP decides: major feature bets, strategic roadmap direction, cross-functional product resources. Director decides: roadmap prioritization within strategic themes, team staffing. PM decides: feature scope, bug prioritization, sprint sequencing."

**Mistake 2: Confusing input with decision rights**

Just because someone has valuable input doesn't mean they should decide or have veto power.

Clarify: "Sales provides required input on customer impact. Product decides based on that input and other factors. Sales does not have veto power."

**Mistake 3: Not revisiting decision rights as organization scales**

What works at 20 people breaks at 200. Decision rights need to evolve as the organization grows.

Regularly review: Are decisions happening at the right level? Is the decision-maker the person with the best information and appropriate accountability?
