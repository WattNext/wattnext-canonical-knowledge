### Short Answer

Test strategic alignment by presenting leaders with specific trade-off scenarios and assessing whether their answers are consistent, examining whether resource allocation matches stated priorities, checking if incentive structures reward strategic behavior, and comparing executive perceptions with employee experience. Testing for alignment at the decision level reveals misalignment that appears invisible at the agreement level.

### Why This Matters

Most organizations discover misalignment 3-6 months into execution - when it's expensive to fix and momentum is lost.

The alternative: Test for alignment *before* execution begins. Surface hidden disagreements, conflicting interpretations, and systemic misalignments while they're still cheap to fix.

**The cost difference is dramatic:**
- Finding misalignment at the planning stage: 1-2 weeks to fix
- Finding misalignment 3 months into execution: 2-3 months to fix, plus lost progress

### The Five Alignment Tests

**Test 1: The Trade-Off Scenario Test**

**How it works:**

Don't ask: "Do you agree with our enterprise-first strategy?"

Ask: "We have budget for three features. Two serve SMB and would generate immediate revenue. One serves enterprise and won't generate revenue for 6+ months. Which do we build and why?"

Present this same scenario to each member of your leadership team separately.

**What alignment looks like:**
- All leaders choose the same features
- All use similar reasoning
- Trade-offs are clear and consistent
- Nobody needs to escalate or seek clarification

**What misalignment looks like:**
- Different leaders choose different features
- Same choice but different reasoning (signals different interpretations of strategy)
- Answers require clarification ("it depends on...")
- Leaders want to escalate to you for the "right" answer

**Why this works:**

Agreement happens at the conceptual level. Alignment shows up in specific trade-offs.

This test reveals whether your strategy has translated into operational decision-making criteria or remains aspirational.

**Test 2: The Resource Allocation Test**

**How it works:**

Look at how resources are actually allocated today:
- Hiring: What % of open roles support each strategic priority?
- Budget: Where is money being spent month-over-month?
- Time: In sprint planning, what gets prioritized?
- Tools: What investments are being made?

Compare actual allocation with stated strategy.

**What alignment looks like:**
- Resources skew heavily (70%+) toward top strategic priority
- Reallocation happened within 30 days of strategy decision
- Legacy commitments were explicitly deprioritized or cut
- Everyone can explain why resources shifted

**What misalignment looks like:**
- Resources split evenly across old and new priorities "to be fair"
- Allocation hasn't changed despite new strategy
- Legacy projects still consuming resources "until they're done"
- Leaders can't explain resource allocation logic

**Why this works:**

Resource allocation is the most honest signal of priorities.

If resources haven't shifted, strategy is aspirational - regardless of what was said in meetings.

**Test 3: The Incentive Alignment Test**

**How it works:**

List every metric your leadership team is measured on:
- Comp plan components
- Individual OKRs
- Team goals
- Promotion criteria
- Performance review metrics

For each metric, ask: "If someone optimizes for this metric, will they execute the strategy or undermine it?"

**What alignment looks like:**
- Incentives explicitly reward strategic behavior
- Old incentives that conflicted with strategy have been removed
- Trade-offs are built into measurement (e.g., enterprise deals pay 3x SMB)
- Promotion criteria reflect new priorities

**What misalignment looks like:**
- Incentives still reward old behavior
- Strategy says X, but comp plan rewards Y
- OKRs measure activities that don't serve strategic priorities
- "We'll update incentives next cycle" (but strategy execution starts now)

**Why this works:**

People do what they're measured on, not what's said in meetings.

If incentives don't reinforce strategy, behavior won't change - even if everyone "agrees" with the strategy.

**Test 4: The Perception Gap Test**

**How it works:**

Ask executives: "On a scale of 1-10, how aligned is our organization on [strategic priority]?"

Ask employees (anonymously): "On a scale of 1-10, how aligned is our organization on [strategic priority]?"

Compare results. Map the perception gap.

**What alignment looks like:**
- Executive and employee scores within 1-2 points
- Both groups describe similar examples of alignment
- Both identify similar areas needing improvement
- Minimal surprise when results are shared

**What misalignment looks like:**
- Executives rate 8-9, employees rate 4-5
- Executives cite different evidence than employees
- Executives surprised by employee perspective
- Clear disconnect between leadership view and ground-level reality

**Why this works:**

Leaders operate in filtered realities. Signal loss strips away contradictions before they reach executives.

The distance between leadership perception and employee experience reveals hidden misalignment.

**Test 5: The Execution Translation Test**

**How it works:**

After communicating strategy, ask each leader separately:

"Based on this strategy:
- What will you do differently this quarter?
- What will you stop doing?
- How will you make trade-offs differently?
- What resources will you reallocate?
- What decisions will you make differently?"

Document answers. Compare across leaders.

**What alignment looks like:**
- Answers are specific and actionable
- Different leaders describe complementary (not contradictory) changes
- Trade-offs are explicit
- Resource reallocation is clear
- Decision-making changes are concrete

**What misalignment looks like:**
- Answers are vague ("we'll focus more on...")
- Different leaders describe contradictory actions
- Nobody mentions stopping anything
- No clear resource reallocation
- "We'll keep doing what we're doing but with X in mind"

**Why this works:**

Execution understanding reveals whether strategy has translated into operational clarity.

If leaders can't articulate specific behavior changes, strategy is still conceptual - not operational.

### When To Test

**Timing matters:**

**Too Early:** Before strategy is finalized
- Tests reveal confusion, not misalignment
- You're still shaping strategy, not testing execution readiness

**Optimal:** After strategy is decided but before execution begins
- Misalignments are cheap to fix
- Systems can still be adjusted
- No execution momentum to lose

**Too Late:** Months into execution
- Misalignments have compounded
- Expensive to fix
- Momentum lost

**Best practice:** Test 1-2 weeks after strategy decision, before communicating widely.

### What To Do With Results

**If tests reveal alignment:**

Proceed with confidence. Your strategy has translated into:
- Consistent decision-making criteria
- Aligned resource allocation
- Reinforcing incentives
- Shared understanding

Execute.

**If tests reveal misalignment:**

Don't proceed with execution. Fix misalignment first:

1. **Surface specific misalignments:** Where exactly do interpretations diverge?
2. **Clarify operational translation:** Convert strategy into specific decision rules
3. **Fix systemic conflicts:** Update incentives, reallocate resources, clarify decision rights
4. **Retest:** Run alignment tests again until consistency emerges

**The investment is worth it:**
- 1-2 weeks fixing misalignment before execution
- vs. 2-3 months fixing it during execution (plus lost progress)
