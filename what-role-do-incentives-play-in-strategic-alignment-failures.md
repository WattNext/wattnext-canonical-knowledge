### Short Answer

Misaligned incentives are the single largest driver of strategic alignment failures. When leaders announce new strategies but don't update comp plans, OKRs, promotion criteria, and recognition systems, teams rationally prioritize what they're measured on over what was said in meetings. Most strategic alignment failures aren't execution problems - they're incentive design problems.

### Why This Matters

You can communicate strategy perfectly, and it will still fail if incentives reward different behavior.

People don't do what you tell them to do. They do what they're measured on, bonused for, promoted for, and publicly recognized for.

If those incentives don't change when strategy changes, neither will behavior.

### The Incentive-Strategy Gap

**Classic Pattern:**

**Monday:** CEO announces "we're going enterprise-first"

**Tuesday-Friday:**
- Sales closes three SMB deals (because quota is quota)
- Product ships SMB features (because velocity metrics reward feature count)
- Marketing targets startups (because MQL targets don't distinguish customer size)
- CS focuses on small accounts (because satisfaction scores weight all customers equally)

**Month 3:** CEO wonders why "enterprise-first" produced zero enterprise results.

**The problem wasn't communication. The problem was incentives still rewarded SMB behavior.**

### The Four Incentive Traps

**Trap 1: Comp Plans Don't Change**

Strategy says "enterprise-first."

Sales comp plan still pays the same commission for SMB deals as enterprise deals.

Enterprise deals take 6-9 months. SMB deals close in 3 weeks.

Rational choice: Close SMB deals, hit quota, earn bonus - while "working on enterprise."

**Fix:** Update comp plans before announcing the strategy. Enterprise deals should pay 2-3x the commission of SMB deals.

**Trap 2: OKRs Measure Old Priorities**

Strategy says "quality over speed."

Engineering OKRs still measure velocity, feature count, and sprint completion rate.

Engineers are rational: They ship fast, cut quality corners, and hit their OKRs.

**Fix:** OKRs should measure what strategy prioritizes. If quality matters, measure: test coverage, defect rates, technical debt reduction, refactoring completion.

**Trap 3: Promotion Criteria Reward Old Behavior**

Strategy says "cross-functional collaboration."

Promotions still go to individuals who deliver their functional goals independently.

Collaborative work is invisible, slow, and unrewarded.

Result: Everyone talks about collaboration, nobody actually does it.

**Fix:** Add "cross-functional impact" as explicit promotion criteria. Reward people who enable other teams, not just those who hit their silo's goals.

**Trap 4: Recognition Celebrates Old Wins**

Strategy says "enterprise-first."

All-hands meeting celebrates the VP who closed the most deals this quarter - all SMB.

Everyone watches. Everyone learns: SMB deals get recognition. Enterprise deals are slow and risky.

**Fix:** Public recognition must align with strategic priorities. Celebrate the first enterprise deal closed, the enterprise feature shipped, the enterprise customer retained.

### Why Leaders Don't Update Incentives

**Reason 1: Timing Lag**

Leaders announce strategy immediately. Updating comp plans, OKRs, and promotion criteria takes time and coordination.

By the time incentives are updated, teams have spent 2-3 months executing the old strategy under new labels.

**Reason 2: "We'll Do It Next Cycle"**

Leaders think: "Let's communicate the strategy now. We'll update comp plans in Q4 planning."

But behavior doesn't wait for Q4. Teams make decisions every day based on current incentives.

**Reason 3: Concern About Disruption**

"If we change comp plans mid-year, the team will revolt."

But asking people to execute a new strategy while rewarding old behavior is more disruptive - and dishonest.

**Reason 4: Underestimating Incentive Power**

Leaders believe: "My team understands the strategic importance. They don't need incentives to align."

Reality: Even the most mission-driven people make rational choices based on what's measured and rewarded.

### What Good Incentive Alignment Looks Like

Organizations that successfully align incentives with strategy:

**Update incentives before communicating strategy**

Comp plans, OKRs, and promotion criteria change *first*. Strategy announcement comes *second*.

Teams receive consistent signals: leadership says X, and the systems reward X.

**Make trade-offs explicit in incentives**

If strategy says "enterprise-first," then:
- Enterprise deals pay 3x SMB commission
- Product velocity OKRs are replaced with enterprise feature completion OKRs
- CS bonuses reflect enterprise retention, not total customer count

The incentive structure makes the trade-off unavoidable.

**Align recognition with strategic priorities**

Every public celebration reinforces what matters:
- All-hands shoutouts
- Promotion announcements
- Performance reviews
- Newsletter features

Recognition is the social proof of what actually gets rewarded.

**Test for incentive conflicts**

Before launching strategy, list every metric the team is measured on.

For each one, ask: "If someone optimizes for this metric, will they execute the strategy or undermine it?"

Fix conflicts before they create execution divergence.

### What To Do Next

**1. Audit your current incentives**

List all measurement systems:
- Comp plans and bonuses
- Individual and team OKRs
- Promotion criteria
- Performance review metrics
- Public recognition and awards

For each, ask: "Does this incentive reinforce our strategy or conflict with it?"

**2. Map strategic priorities to incentive changes**

For each strategic priority, identify:
- What behavior should increase? (update incentives to reward it)
- What behavior should decrease? (remove incentives that reward it)
- What trade-offs should people make? (make that trade-off explicit in measurements)

**3. Sequence changes correctly**

Don't announce strategy until incentives are updated.

Sequence:
1. Update comp plans, OKRs, promotion criteria
2. Communicate why these changed
3. Announce the strategy
4. Reinforce through recognition and review cycles

**4. Communicate the incentive logic**

Don't just change incentives - explain the reasoning:

"We're shifting to enterprise-first. That means:
- Enterprise deals now pay 3x commission because they're harder but more strategic
- Your OKRs now measure enterprise feature completion, not total features
- Promotions will reward enterprise impact, not SMB velocity

We're aligning what you're measured on with where we're going."

Transparency builds trust. Surprise changes breed resentment.
