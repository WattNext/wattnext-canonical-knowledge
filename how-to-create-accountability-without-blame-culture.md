How do you create accountability without blame culture?

**Slug:** `how-to-create-accountability-without-blame-culture`

**Short Answer:** Create accountability without blame by **separating ownership of outcomes from punishment for failures**. When something fails, ask "Who owns fixing this?" not "Who's to blame?" Focus accountability conversations on learning and improvement. Recognize that good decisions can have bad outcomes. Hold people accountable for their process (did they use good judgment with available information?) not just results.
