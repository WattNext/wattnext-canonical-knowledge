What causes the gap between decision and execution?

### Short Answer

The gap between decision and execution happens when **people don't understand the decision, don't believe in it, or don't know what's expected of them**. Specifically: (1) the decision was made without explaining the reasoning, so people don't understand why, (2) key stakeholders weren't consulted so they don't buy in, (3) the decision is vague about what actually needs to happen, so people don't know what to do, or (4) the decision conflicts with other priorities/incentives, so people rationally ignore it. Closing this gap requires making the reasoning explicit, involving the right people in the decision process, translating decisions into clear actions, and aligning incentives.

### Why This Matters

**61% of executives say poor decision-making is the single biggest barrier to executing strategy** (McKinsey Global Survey, 2024). But often the issue isn't bad decisions - it's the gap between deciding and executing.

Leadership makes strategic decision. Months later, nothing has changed. Leadership assumes it's an execution problem. Actually, it's a decision-making problem - specifically, how the decision was made and communicated.

When decisions don't lead to execution, organizations waste time making more decisions, creating more policies, sending more communications. None of which fix the root cause.

### The Four Causes of Decision-Execution Gap

**Cause 1: Decision Without Reasoning**

**What it looks like:**

Leadership decides: "We're moving upmarket to enterprise."

Email goes out announcing the decision.

Product team: "Why enterprise? What about our mid-market customers?"
Sales team: "Enterprise sales cycles are 18 months. How does this affect our quarterly targets?"
Marketing team: "What should we do with our existing mid-market campaigns?"

Nobody knows why this decision was made or what it means for their work.

Result: Confusion, anxiety, and paralysis. Execution stalls.

**Why this happens:**

Leaders communicate the conclusion (what was decided) but not the reasoning (why, what alternatives were considered, what trade-offs were made).

They assume the conclusion is sufficient. It's not.

People need to understand:
- **Why** this decision was made
- What **alternatives** were considered
- What **trade-offs** were accepted
- What this means for **their specific work**

Without this context, the decision feels arbitrary. People don't know how to execute it or whether to take it seriously.

**The fix:**

When communicating decisions, include:
- **The decision:** What we're doing
- **The why:** What problem this solves, what opportunity this captures
- **The alternatives:** What else we considered and why we didn't choose those
- **The trade-offs:** What we're sacrificing or deprioritizing
- **The implications:** What this means for each function

Example:

"Decision: We're moving upmarket to enterprise.

Why: Mid-market revenue growth has plateaued. Enterprise customers have 5x ACV and 3x retention. Our product is now enterprise-ready after recent compliance investments.

Alternatives considered: (1) Double down on mid-market volume, (2) Expand to adjacent verticals. We chose enterprise because it leverages our recent product investments and our margin economics improve significantly.

Trade-offs: We're accepting longer sales cycles and need to rebuild sales playbook. We're deprioritizing self-serve and SMB segments.

Implications:
- Product: Prioritize enterprise compliance and admin features over consumer-grade UX
- Sales: Rebuild for solution selling, accept lower velocity short-term
- Marketing: Shift from product-led to account-based marketing"

Now people understand the decision and know what to do.

**Cause 2: Decision Without Buy-In**

**What it looks like:**

CEO makes decision without consulting VPs. Announces it in all-hands.

VPs are surprised. They weren't consulted. Some disagree with the decision.

VPs don't actively oppose it (that would be insubordination). But they don't actively support it either.

Their teams detect the lack of enthusiasm. Teams execute halfheartedly or wait to see if the decision will actually stick.

**Why this happens:**

Decision-maker didn't involve the people who need to execute the decision.

Those people feel:
- Not trusted (why wasn't I consulted?)
- Not informed (I don't have context others have)
- Not committed (this isn't my decision, I'm just executing someone else's call)

**The fix:**

Distinguish between:
- **Who decides:** The person with final authority
- **Who must provide input:** People whose perspective materially affects decision quality
- **Who should be consulted:** People whose buy-in is critical for execution

Make sure execution-critical stakeholders are consulted before the decision, not informed after.

Example:

Decision: Move upmarket to enterprise

Who decides: CEO

Required input: CFO (unit economics), VP Product (product readiness), VP Sales (sales capability)

Should consult: All VPs (because they need to buy in and execute)

Process:
1. CEO gathers required input from CFO, VP Product, VP Sales
2. CEO shares draft decision with all VPs, asks for concerns
3. CEO makes final decision incorporating input
4. VPs are now committed because they were consulted and their concerns were heard

Even VPs who would have chosen differently now support the decision because they were part of the process.

**Cause 3: Decision Without Clarity on Actions**

**What it looks like:**

Leadership decides: "We need to improve customer experience."

Email goes out. Everyone nods.

Three months later, nothing has changed.

Leadership: "Why hasn't customer experience improved?"

Teams: "We didn't know what specifically we were supposed to do."

**Why this happens:**

The decision is directionally correct but operationally vague.

"Improve customer experience" could mean:
- Reduce support response times
- Improve product reliability
- Redesign onboarding
- Add more features
- Improve documentation

Without clarity on what specifically should happen, everyone interprets it differently (or does nothing).

**The fix:**

Translate strategic decisions into specific actions:

Bad: "Improve customer experience"

Good: "Improve customer experience by:
1. Reducing support first-response time from 24 hours to 4 hours (CS team, complete by Q2)
2. Increasing product uptime from 99.5% to 99.9% (Engineering team, complete by Q3)
3. Redesigning onboarding to reduce time-to-value from 7 days to 2 days (Product team, complete by Q2)"

Now teams know exactly what to do.

**Cause 4: Decision Conflicts With Incentives**

**What it looks like:**

Leadership decides: "Prioritize long-term customer value over short-term revenue."

But Sales comp plan rewards quarterly revenue, not customer lifetime value.

Sales rationally optimizes for what they're measured and compensated on (quarterly revenue), not what leadership said to prioritize (long-term value).

Leadership sees Sales still closing short-term deals. Assumes Sales isn't executing the strategy. Actually, Sales is executing exactly what they're incentivized to do.

**Why this happens:**

Decisions conflict with existing systems:
- Compensation plans
- Performance metrics
- Promotion criteria
- Resource allocation

When decision and systems conflict, systems win. People rationally optimize for what they're actually measured and rewarded on, not what leadership says.

**The fix:**

When making strategic decisions, audit and align systems:

Decision: "Prioritize long-term customer value"

System changes required:
- Sales comp: Add component for customer retention and expansion, not just new bookings
- Metrics: Track customer lifetime value, not just quarterly revenue
- Promotions: Recognize people who build sustainable customer relationships, not just hit quarterly targets
- Resources: Invest in customer success and product quality, not just sales capacity

If you don't change the systems, the decision won't change behavior.

### Closing the Decision-Execution Gap

**Step 1: Communicate reasoning, not just conclusions**

Every significant decision should include: the decision, the why, alternatives considered, trade-offs accepted, functional implications.

**Step 2: Involve execution-critical stakeholders before deciding**

Don't just inform people after. Consult them before so they have buy-in.

**Step 3: Translate decisions into specific actions**

Strategic decisions should cascade into concrete, assigned actions with owners and timelines.

**Step 4: Align systems with decisions**

Audit compensation, metrics, promotion criteria, resource allocation. Change systems to reinforce the decision.

When these four elements exist, decisions lead to execution naturally. When they're absent, even good decisions die in the gap between deciding and doing.
