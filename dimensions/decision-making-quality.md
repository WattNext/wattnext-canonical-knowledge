# Decision-Making Quality: Why Smart People Keep Making Preventable Mistakes

## The Decision Theater

Your leadership team is smart. Experienced. Well-intentioned. You've hired the best people you could find.

And yet:

The product team just spent six months building a feature nobody asked for because they thought that's what sales wanted. Sales is furious - this isn't what they meant at all.

Marketing launched a campaign targeting enterprise buyers the same week sales shifted focus to mid-market because enterprise deals were taking too long to close. Nobody told marketing.

Engineering is three sprints deep into a technical architecture decision that conflicts with the strategic pivot leadership announced last month. They never heard about the pivot. Leadership assumed engineering leadership would cascade it.

Finance approved a hire that HR said was outside compensation bands. HR thought finance would flag it if it was a problem. Finance thought HR had already vetted it.

Nobody made a stupid decision. Everyone made the decision that seemed right with the information they had. The problem isn't the people. It's the system that determines who decides what, with what information, using which frameworks.

## What We Assess

When diagnosing decision-making quality, we examine whether your organization has built the infrastructure to consistently make good decisions - not whether smart people exist in your company.

**We look at:**
- Whether decision rights are clear (who actually decides what)
- How effectively information reaches decision-makers before decisions get made
- Whether decisions are made at the right organizational level
- If there are shared frameworks for evaluating trade-offs
- How quickly decisions get made when speed matters
- Whether decisions get revisited when new information emerges
- What happens to decisions after they're made (execution, learning, adaptation)

## Why It Matters

Decision quality compounds. Good decisions create options. Bad decisions narrow them. Over time, the gap becomes your competitive advantage or disadvantage.

**Organizations with strong decision-making capabilities deliver 5-6% higher total returns to shareholders than competitors** (Bain & Company, 2023). But the research undersells the mechanism.

The real impact: **Decision-making quality determines your organizational metabolism.** How fast you can move. How much coordination overhead you need. How often you have to redo work because the wrong person made the wrong call with the wrong information.

Companies with poor decision-making don't just make bad choices - they make decisions slowly, remake them repeatedly, and waste enormous energy navigating around the damage from previous decisions.

**61% of executives say that poor decision-making is the single biggest barrier to executing strategy** (McKinsey Global Survey, 2024). Not bad strategy. Not poor execution capability. Decision-making quality.

## What Good Looks Like

**High-quality decision-making:**
- Clear decision rights: everyone knows who decides and who provides input
- Information flows to decision-makers before decisions, not after
- Decisions get made at the lowest competent level, not escalated by default
- Shared mental models about what constitutes a good decision in this context
- Speed matches stakes: routine decisions move fast, irreversible ones get appropriate scrutiny
- When context changes significantly, decisions get revisited without ego
- Execution follows clearly because people understand the decision and the reasoning

**Example:** A SaaS company faces a competitive threat:
- The decision is escalated to the product VP (clear ownership)
- She pulls in data from sales (win/loss analysis), customer success (churn signals), and engineering (effort estimates)
- The framework is explicit: "Will this move the needle on enterprise retention within 90 days?"
- Decision made in 48 hours: yes, we build the defensive feature
- Product manager has authority to make implementation trade-offs without re-escalating
- Two months in, customer data shows the feature isn't working as expected
- Decision gets revisited: pivot to different approach, no finger-pointing about the initial call
- The team learns: we can make fast decisions when stakes are clear and revisit them when we learn

## What Poor Decision-Making Looks Like

**Low-quality decision-making:**
- Unclear decision rights: multiple people think they decide, or nobody does
- Decisions get made before critical information surfaces
- Everything escalates because people fear making the wrong call
- No shared framework: decisions are vibes-based or whoever-shouts-loudest
- Analysis paralysis on reversible decisions; recklessness on irreversible ones
- Decisions are final even when obviously wrong because leadership "already decided"
- Execution stalls because nobody understands the decision or believes in it

**Example:** A different SaaS company faces the same competitive threat:
- Product thinks they should decide. Engineering thinks it's a technical call. Sales thinks it's their customer relationships at stake.
- Three weeks of meetings to figure out who decides
- Eventually CEO steps in and makes the call based on a hallway conversation
- Engineering wasn't consulted; the solution is technically infeasible
- Two weeks wasted before someone finally surfaces that this won't work
- CEO is annoyed: "Why didn't you say this earlier?"
- New decision: different approach, but nobody's clear if CEO owns this or if they can make implementation calls
- Team learns: decision-making here is chaotic, so wait for explicit direction before doing anything

## Why Leaders Miss This

Decision-making quality degrades invisibly:

1. **Good outcomes mask bad process.** You made the right call despite having terrible information or unclear ownership. You got lucky. But the system didn't improve.

2. **Leaders only see the decisions that reach them.** You don't see the hundreds of decisions that got escalated unnecessarily, delayed indefinitely, or made badly three levels down.

3. **Decision-making quality varies by altitude.** The exec team might have great decision hygiene. Middle management might be a complete mess. You'd never know.

4. **The system optimizes for CYA, not quality.** When decision-making breaks down, people learn to protect themselves: over-include stakeholders, document everything, escalate anything risky. This looks like diligence. It's actually organizational scar tissue.

By the time decision-making problems reach your awareness, they've already cost months of wasted effort and missed opportunities.

## What To Do Next

**If you suspect decision-making problems:**

1. **Map who actually makes decisions versus who thinks they do.** Pick five recent important decisions. Ask separately: who made this decision? If you get different answers, your decision rights are unclear.

2. **Trace information flow before decisions.** Were decision-makers working with the right information at the right time? Or did critical data surface after the decision was made?

3. **Examine decision velocity versus decision stakes.** Are trivial decisions taking weeks? Are irreversible decisions getting made in minutes? If velocity doesn't match stakes, your decision-making is miscalibrated.

4. **Check whether decisions stick or thrash.** How often do decisions get remade, reversed, or ignored? High thrash means either poor initial decisions or inability to commit and execute.
