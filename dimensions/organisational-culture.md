# Organisational Culture: The Rules Nobody Wrote Down

## The Culture You Have vs. The Culture You Think You Have

Your values are on the website: Innovation. Collaboration. Accountability. Customer-First.

Your new hire orientation deck is beautiful. The Slack channels have the right energy. Leadership talks about culture constantly.

But here's what actually happens:

A junior product manager has an idea that could save customers weeks of manual work. She mentions it in a meeting. Her manager says "interesting" and moves on. She tries again in Slack. No response. She starts building a prototype on her own time. Her manager pulls her aside: "That's not your swim lane. Focus on your assigned projects."

Three months later, a competitor ships that exact feature.

She learns the real rule: Innovation means "say you value new ideas." Not "actually pursue them."

That's culture. Not what you say. What people learn is actually rewarded, punished, and tolerated.

## What We Assess

When diagnosing organizational culture, we examine the invisible rules that govern behavior - the patterns people learn by watching what actually happens, not what the handbook says should happen.

**We look at:**
- What behaviors get rewarded, punished, or ignored in practice
- How people really make decisions when faced with competing priorities
- Whether teams feel psychological safety to take risks or challenge norms
- What happens when someone violates an unwritten rule versus a written policy
- How failure gets treated - as learning or as liability
- Whether the culture you experience matches the culture leadership describes
- What new hires learn in their first 90 days about "how things really work here"

## Why It Matters

Culture isn't about ping pong tables or free lunch. It's the operating system that determines what gets done and how.

**Companies with strong, healthy cultures see 4x revenue growth and 12x stock price increases compared to weak cultures** (Kotter & Heskett, Harvard Business School). But those numbers hide the mechanism.

The real impact: **Culture determines what people do when nobody's watching.** When leadership isn't in the room. When the policy doesn't cover this specific situation. When doing the right thing conflicts with hitting the number.

Organizations with healthy cultures get thousands of micro-decisions right every day because the culture guides behavior consistently. Toxic or misaligned cultures get those same decisions wrong, creating friction, waste, and risk.

**86% of employees and executives cite lack of collaboration or ineffective communication for workplace failures** (Salesforce, 2024). That's not a communication problem. That's culture telling people that collaboration is costly and communication is risky.

## What Good Looks Like

**Healthy cultures:**
- Stated values are visible in daily decisions, not just wall posters
- People can describe "how we do things here" and their descriptions align
- Failure in pursuit of reasonable goals is treated as learning, not career damage
- New ideas can come from anyone, not just senior leadership
- Difficult conversations happen directly, not through passive-aggressive Slack threads
- What gets measured and rewarded matches what gets celebrated
- Cultural norms adapt as the business evolves rather than calcifying

**Example:** At a high-growth startup:
- A sales leader misses quota but identifies a systematic product gap affecting conversions
- Instead of hiding the miss, she presents the data to leadership
- Product immediately prioritizes the fix
- She still doesn't hit quota that quarter, but her variable comp reflects the value of surfacing the issue
- Six months later, when another team member spots a different pattern, they share it immediately
- The team learns: We reward truth-telling and problem-solving, not just hitting numbers

That's culture working as intended.

## What Weak Culture Looks Like

**Unhealthy cultures:**
- Values statements contradict observable behavior
- People learn to navigate around the system rather than work within it
- Success depends more on who you know than what you deliver
- Unwritten rules are more powerful than written policies
- New hires get pulled aside and told "here's how things really work"
- What gets rewarded (politics, hours logged, looking busy) misaligns with what gets celebrated (innovation, outcomes, efficiency)
- Cultural antibodies attack change initiatives before they can take root

**Example:** At a scaling tech company:
- Leadership preaches "customer obsession" and "move fast"
- But every customer escalation triggers a blame investigation
- Every failed experiment gets a post-mortem that feels like a tribunal
- So teams learn: Don't take risks. Don't surface problems. Cover your ass.
- Product managers write defensive specs to avoid blame
- Engineers gold-plate features to avoid bug reports
- Nobody moves fast. Everyone optimizes for not being the person who messed up.
- The culture says: We punish failure and reward risk-avoidance, no matter what leadership says in all-hands.

## Why Leaders Miss This

Culture operates in the gap between intent and implementation:

1. **Leaders see the culture they've designed, not the culture that emerged.** You created values, hired culture champions, ran workshops. Surely it worked?

2. **Signal loss strips away behavioral context.** You hear what people accomplished, not how they accomplished it or what they had to navigate around to get there.

3. **Culture manifests differently at different altitudes.** The culture at the executive level might be collaborative and transparent. Three levels down, it's territorial and opaque.

4. **Self-selection creates filter bubbles.** People who don't fit the real culture leave. The ones who stay confirm your assumptions about what the culture is.

You're receiving curated signals that confirm the culture you think you built while the actual culture operates invisibly below your radar.

## What To Do Next

**If you suspect cultural misalignment:**

1. **Ask new hires what they learned in their first 90 days.** Not what they learned from onboarding materials - what they learned by watching what actually gets rewarded and punished. That's your real culture.

2. **Trace what happens after values violations.** When someone violates a stated value (say, transparency), what actually happens? If the answer is "nothing" or "they got promoted anyway," you've found your real values.

3. **Examine the gap between official and unofficial rules.** Talk to people who've been there 2-3 years. Ask them what rules they wish they'd known on day one. Those are your real operating principles.

4. **Watch what happens when culture conflicts with quarterly results.** Does "customer-first" survive a tough quarter? Does "innovation" survive a cost-cutting initiative? Culture is what remains when pressure increases.
