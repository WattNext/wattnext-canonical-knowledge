# Support for Teams: The Manager Problem Nobody Wants to Name

## The Invisible Failure Point

Your company invests millions in recruiting talent. You hire brilliant people. They show up motivated, capable, ready to contribute.

Six months later, they're disengaged. Not because the work isn't interesting. Not because the mission doesn't matter. Not because they're not talented enough.

They're disengaged because their manager doesn't know how to enable them.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **Most organizational performance problems aren't strategy problems or talent problems. They're manager problems.** But because managers are everywhere and their impact is diffuse, the dysfunction becomes invisible. Teams underperform, and everyone blames the market, the strategy, the resources - anything except the most obvious failure point.

## What We Assess

When diagnosing support for teams, we examine whether teams have what they need to succeed - not just tools and budget, but effective leadership and enabling conditions.

**We look at:**
- Whether managers create clarity or add confusion
- How effectively managers remove blockers versus creating them
- Whether teams feel supported in their development and growth
- How managers handle feedback, conflict, and performance issues
- Whether management practices enable autonomy or create dependency
- How consistently support exists across different teams and managers
- Whether managers act as advocates for their teams or gatekeepers

## Why It Matters

**Teams with highly effective managers are 3x more engaged and 2x more productive** (Gallup, 2024). Yet here's the crisis: **82% of managers are promoted based on individual contributor performance, not management capability** (CEB Global, 2024). And **58% of managers report receiving no management training** (CareerBuilder, 2024).

The math is brutal. Your organization's performance is mediated through your managers. If managers can't enable their teams, nothing else matters - not your strategy, not your talent, not your market opportunity. You've created bottlenecks at every layer of your organization.

And here's what makes this particularly dangerous: **Poor management doesn't show up as obvious failure.** It shows up as teams that consistently underdeliver. As good people who quietly check out. As organizations that work hard but don't move fast.

## What Good Looks Like

**Strong team support:**
- Managers translate strategy into clear team objectives
- Blockers get resolved quickly without constant escalation
- Teams feel psychologically safe taking risks and raising concerns
- Managers provide coaching that accelerates development
- Performance conversations happen regularly, not just during reviews
- Teams have what they need when they need it
- Managers advocate for their teams while maintaining organizational perspective
- People stay because of their manager, not despite them
- Support is consistent across teams, not dependent on manager lottery

**Example:** A design team is behind on a major project:
- The manager proactively identifies the blocker (missing technical specs)
- She escalates to unblock, doesn't just tell the team to "work harder"
- She provides air cover while the team catches up
- She coaches junior designers through difficult client feedback
- She adjusts scope based on reality, not wishful thinking
- Team members feel supported, not blamed
- The project ships late but with quality, and the team learns from it
- Nobody quits, and the next project goes better

## What Weak Support Looks Like

**Organizations with poor team support:**
- Managers create work instead of removing obstacles
- Teams are stuck waiting for decisions or resources that never come
- People don't feel safe admitting challenges or asking for help
- Managers avoid difficult conversations until problems become crises
- Development happens accidentally, not intentionally
- Teams compensate for weak management by working around their managers
- Support quality depends entirely on which manager you get
- Exit interviews reveal "my manager" as the top reason for leaving
- Good people leave, mediocre people stay

**Example:** A sales team is missing quota:
- The manager blames the team in leadership meetings
- Instead of removing obstacles, he adds more check-ins and reporting
- Team members stop admitting when deals are at risk
- Coaching consists of "close more deals" and "try harder"
- The manager hordes information to maintain control
- Top performers leave for competitors
- The manager blames "talent quality" and demands more recruiting budget
- The cycle repeats with new hires

## The Manager Capability Crisis

Most organizations accidentally create ineffective managers through a predictable pattern:

**1. Promotion Based on Wrong Criteria:** Your best engineer becomes an engineering manager. Your top salesperson becomes a sales manager. But technical excellence and management capability are different skills.

**2. No Training or Onboarding:** You'd never let someone write production code without training. But you let them manage people with zero preparation.

**3. Misaligned Incentives:** Managers get rewarded for output, not for developing their teams. So they optimize for short-term delivery at the expense of long-term capability building.

**4. No Feedback Loops:** Managers don't see the impact of their dysfunction until people quit. By then, the damage is done and the feedback is gone.

**5. Learned Helplessness:** Bad managers were often poorly managed themselves. They replicate the only management they've experienced.

The result? An organization full of accidental managers who don't know how to enable their teams and have no structural support to learn.

## The Support Spectrum

Team support exists on a spectrum. Most organizations operate in the middle - not catastrophically bad, but not enabling either:

**Level 1 - Active Obstruction:** Managers create more work than they remove. They're bottlenecks, not enablers. Teams work around them.

**Level 2 - Benign Neglect:** Managers don't actively harm, but they don't help either. They're administrators, not leaders. Teams succeed despite them.

**Level 3 - Transactional Support:** Managers respond to requests but don't proactively enable. They're reactive, not anticipatory. Teams get what they ask for, nothing more.

**Level 4 - Proactive Enablement:** Managers remove obstacles before teams hit them. They create conditions for success. Teams operate with autonomy because support is reliable.

**Level 5 - Force Multiplication:** Managers make their teams better than the sum of individuals. They unlock potential people didn't know they had. Teams do their best work.

Most organizations hover between Levels 2 and 3. High-performing organizations operate at Levels 4 and 5.

## Why Leaders Miss This

Leadership teams often can't see support problems because:

1. **Work gets done.** Teams deliver (barely), so leadership assumes support is adequate. They don't see the extraordinary effort required to compensate for weak management.

2. **Managers manage up well.** The same managers who can't enable their teams are often skilled at presenting well in leadership meetings.

3. **Problems get attributed to individuals.** When a team underperforms, leadership blames the team or the strategy. They rarely examine whether the manager enabled success.

4. **Support quality is invisible from a distance.** You can measure output. You can't easily measure whether managers are creating or destroying team capability.

The system provides almost no signal that management quality is the constraint until turnover spikes or engagement scores crater - by which point you've lost your best people.

## The Hidden Costs

Poor team support doesn't just hurt performance - it fundamentally changes organizational dynamics:

**Talent Exodus:** Your best people have options. They leave not because the work isn't interesting, but because their manager makes it exhausting.

**Risk Aversion:** When teams don't feel supported, they avoid risk. They do what's safe, not what's right. Innovation dies.

**Learned Helplessness:** When blockers never get removed, teams stop trying to operate with urgency. They accept dysfunction as permanent.

**Coordination Overhead:** When managers can't enable their teams, people route around them. Decision-making slows. Bureaucracy grows.

**Capability Degradation:** Without intentional development, teams don't grow. Your organizational capability depreciates over time.

## What To Do Next

**If you suspect support issues:**

1. **Assess support quality team by team.** Don't average across the organization. Identify which teams feel well-supported and which don't. The variance will tell you if you have a systemic issue or a manager quality issue.

2. **Examine what gets escalated.** If managers constantly escalate decisions or blockers upward, they're not enabling their teams - they're routing around their responsibility.

3. **Track where good people go.** Do your top performers cluster under certain managers? Do they leave from under certain managers? Talent voting with their feet reveals support quality.

4. **Look at team velocity over time.** Teams with good support get faster. Teams with poor support slow down. Track cycle time, delivery predictability, and autonomy levels.

5. **Ask teams directly.** The most reliable signal is the least comfortable question: "Does your manager enable your best work?" If the answer is consistently no, you know where to invest.
