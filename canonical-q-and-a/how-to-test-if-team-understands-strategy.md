How do you test if your team actually understands your strategy?

### Short Answer

Test strategy understanding by **observing trade-off decisions, not by asking if people "get it."** Present five leaders from different functions with real prioritization dilemmas: "Should we build Feature A (target segment) or Feature B (adjacent segment)?" If answers are consistent and align with stated strategy, understanding is real. If answers diverge or require debate, people are operating from different interpretations. Additionally, ask new hires (30-60 days) to describe your customer, differentiation, and what you say no to - their answers reveal whether strategic direction has been communicated clearly.

### Why Asking "Do You Understand?" Fails

When leaders ask "Does everyone understand the strategy?" in a meeting, people say yes.

That's social conformity, not confirmation of understanding.

People don't want to look confused in front of leadership. They assume everyone else gets it. They assume they'll figure it out later. Or they think they do understand it (but their interpretation differs from everyone else's).

**Only 14% of employees can accurately describe their company's strategy, priorities, and required actions** (Harvard Business Review). Yet if you surveyed those same employees, most would say they understand the strategy.

Understanding must be tested behaviorally, not verbally.

### Test 1: Trade-Off Resolution

**How it works:**

Present real or hypothetical prioritization dilemmas to five leaders from different functions independently. Don't let them confer. Record their answers.

**Example trade-offs:**

1. **Feature prioritization:** "We have capacity for one initiative this quarter. Should we build Feature A (serves our core segment deeply) or Feature B (opens adjacent high-value segment)?"

2. **Customer requests:** "Our biggest customer is requesting Feature X. It's not on our strategic roadmap. Do we build it?"

3. **Hiring:** "We can hire one person. Should we hire a specialist in our core competency or a generalist who enables expansion?"

4. **Market expansion:** "We have an opportunity to enter Market Y. It's adjacent to our core but requires different positioning. Do we pursue it?"

**Evaluate results:**

- **High alignment:** 4-5 people give the same answer with similar reasoning → Strategic direction is clear
- **Moderate alignment:** 3 people agree, 2 disagree → Strategic direction exists but isn't fully internalized
- **Low alignment:** Answers scatter, reasoning differs → Vision exists, strategic direction doesn't

**What you're testing:**

Not whether people can recite the strategy, but whether strategy governs their actual decision-making consistently.

### Test 2: New Hire Understanding

**How it works:**

Ask employees who've been with the company 30-90 days to answer three questions in writing:

1. Who is our customer? (Be specific - not "businesses" but "which businesses?")
2. What problem do we solve better than anyone else?
3. What kinds of opportunities should we say no to, even if they're tempting?

**Why new hires:**

They don't have institutional knowledge or context. If they can answer accurately, strategic direction has been communicated clearly and reinforced consistently.

If they give vague answers ("we help companies grow") or incorrect answers, either strategic direction wasn't communicated or it contradicts what they've observed.

**Evaluate answers:**

- **Specificity indicates clarity:** "50-500 employee SaaS companies post-PMF" beats "mid-market companies"
- **Consistency indicates shared understanding:** If five new hires give similar answers, strategic direction is being transmitted
- **Actionability indicates usefulness:** If they can describe what to say no to, strategy is guiding decisions

### Test 3: Resource Allocation Audit

**How it works:**

Examine where resources (time, money, headcount) actually go. Compare to stated strategy.

**Example:**

Stated strategy: "We focus on mid-market segment."

Resource allocation:
- 40% of engineering time on mid-market features
- 30% on enterprise features
- 30% on SMB features

**What this reveals:**

Your real strategy is "serve all segments," not "focus on mid-market."

People learn strategy from what gets funded, not what gets said. If resource allocation contradicts stated strategy, people will execute the real strategy (revealed through resources) not the stated strategy (revealed through communication).

**Evaluate:**

Does actual resource allocation match stated priorities?
- If yes → Strategy is real and understood
- If no → Stated strategy is aspiration, real strategy is whatever gets funded

### Test 4: Decision Pattern Analysis

**How it works:**

Review the last 10 significant decisions (product features shipped, deals closed, marketing campaigns launched, hires made).

For each decision, ask: Does this align with our stated strategy?

**Scoring:**
- 8-10 aligned → Strategy governs decisions
- 5-7 aligned → Strategy influences but doesn't govern
- 0-4 aligned → Strategy is rhetoric, decisions are reactive

**What you're testing:**

Whether strategy is a decision-making filter or a talking point.

If most decisions align with stated strategy, understanding is real and operational. If decisions scatter or contradict strategy, either understanding is absent or strategy isn't actually guiding behavior.

### Test 5: Cross-Functional Plan Review

**How it works:**

Have Product, Sales, Marketing, and Engineering independently present their quarterly plans.

Evaluate:
- Do plans align without explicit coordination?
- Do they target the same customer segment?
- Do they reinforce the same differentiation?
- Do they reflect the same trade-offs?

**High alignment without coordination signals clear strategic direction.**

If Product is building for mid-market, Sales is selling to mid-market, and Marketing is targeting mid-market without needing a coordination meeting, strategic direction is clear enough that alignment happens automatically.

**Low alignment despite coordination signals unclear strategic direction.**

If teams need extensive alignment meetings to ensure they're working toward the same goals, strategic direction isn't clear enough to guide independently.

### What to Do When Tests Reveal Gaps

1. **Don't communicate more - clarify more:** The problem isn't volume of communication. It's operational ambiguity in the strategy itself.

2. **Make trade-offs explicit:** Strategy isn't just what you're for. It's what you're against and what you're willing to sacrifice.

3. **Translate strategy functionally:** Tell each function specifically what strategy means for their decisions, not just the general vision.

4. **Use real decisions as teaching moments:** When a decision contradicts strategy, name it explicitly and use it to reinforce strategic direction.

5. **Align resource allocation with stated strategy:** If you say "focus on mid-market" but fund enterprise and SMB initiatives equally, change either your statement or your allocation.
