# How do you update process without creating chaos?

## Short Answer

Version process, test changes small-scale, communicate why

## Why This Matters

Most organizations handle process changes in ways that create disruption without improving outcomes. Either they force new processes on people all at once, generating resistance and chaos, or they announce new processes but never enforce them, so new and old ways coexist in confusion. Both approaches create problems. Forced changes cause people to work around them. Optional changes create inconsistency. Neither approach actually succeeds in improving how work gets done.

The challenge is that processes are embedded in how people work. Changing process means changing behaviors, habits, and muscle memory - all at once and across multiple people. This is cognitively expensive. People have to think about every step, which slows them down. Mistakes happen because they're not yet automatic. The process looks broken even if it's actually better than the old way.

Process change also creates risk during transition. If the old and new processes coexist, confusion reigns - people aren't sure which to follow, data gets captured in different ways, consistency breaks. If old process is abandoned abruptly, new process has to work perfectly immediately, which rarely happens.

**Updating process successfully requires three coordinated approaches:**

First, version process explicitly. Don't replace the old process - create a new version and manage the transition. Have a specific date when the new version goes live. Make old version inaccessible before that date so there's no ambiguity about which process to follow. The versioning makes transition deliberate rather than ambiguous.

Second, test changes small-scale before full rollout. Implement the new process with a subset of teams or use cases first. This reveals problems while the blast radius is small. Teams can provide feedback. You can adjust before full rollout. This is far cheaper than discovering problems after rolling out to everyone.

Third, communicate the why, not just the what. People follow processes better when they understand the reasoning. Why is this change happening? What problem does it solve? How will it improve work? How will people be affected? Transparent communication about reasoning reduces resistance. People who understand why are more willing to tolerate transition difficulty.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Forcing new processes on everyone simultaneously without testing. Not communicating reasoning behind changes. Creating new processes without understanding what problems they solve. Announcing changes but not enforcing transition, so people mix old and new ways. Building new processes without input from people doing the work. Not providing training on new processes. Treating transition difficulty as sign that people are resistant rather than as normal learning curve.

WattNext's process diagnostics examine whether process changes are managed systematically, whether new processes are tested before rollout, and whether organizations have mechanisms for managing transition rather than just announcing change.
