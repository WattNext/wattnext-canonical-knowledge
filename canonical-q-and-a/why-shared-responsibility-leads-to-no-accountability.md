Why does shared responsibility lead to no accountability?

**Slug:** `why-shared-responsibility-leads-to-no-accountability`

**Short Answer:** Shared responsibility leads to no accountability because **when everyone owns something, nobody feels individually accountable for outcomes**. "We're all responsible for customer success" sounds collaborative but means Product thinks CS owns it, CS thinks Product owns it, and when customers churn, everyone says "I did my part." True accountability requires one clear owner with decision authority, while others contribute with defined roles.
