# How do you capture tacit knowledge?

## Short Answer

Record decision context, not just decisions + regular knowledge sharing

## Why This Matters

Most organizations lose critical knowledge when people leave, retire, or change roles. This isn't because people are unwilling to share - it's because tacit knowledge (the "how" and "why" behind decisions) doesn't translate easily into documents. Someone might write down a process, but they rarely document the judgment calls, the edge cases, the shortcuts learned through years of experience, or the reasoning behind seemingly arbitrary rules. When that person leaves, their knowledge walks out the door.

The challenge is that tacit knowledge feels invisible to the person holding it. Experts make decisions so automatically that they can't always articulate why. They know "this vendor is reliable but slow" but might never mention that when they skip the normal approval process. They understand which customer complaints signal real systemic issues versus one-off problems. This judgment is invaluable, but it's almost impossible to capture after the fact.

Recording decision context requires fundamentally different approaches than traditional documentation. Instead of waiting until someone leaves to try capturing their expertise, organizations need to make knowledge sharing an ongoing practice built into daily work.

**Building effective tacit knowledge capture requires three reinforcing practices:**

First, record decision rationale in real time. When major decisions get made, document not just what was decided but why - the constraints considered, alternatives rejected, assumptions made. This context is what transforms a decision log from historical record to learning resource. Teams that require brief decision summaries (why we chose this vendor, why we use this architecture pattern) create a searchable library of collective judgment.

Second, establish regular knowledge-sharing practices that make tacit expertise explicit. This might be "learning lunches" where experts explain their craft, rotating pairing sessions, or documented case studies of how actual problems were solved. The key is making knowledge surfacing part of normal work, not an extra burden. When sharing is structured and scheduled, it happens consistently.

Third, create mechanisms for capturing unexpected knowledge. When someone solves an unusual problem, spots a workaround, or learns something new, there needs to be a simple way to record it. Slack channels, quick-capture templates, or post-mortems create trails of tacit knowledge that would otherwise disappear.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Organizations that only try to capture knowledge during offboarding (too late - the person is already distracted). Documentation that records processes but never the judgment calls behind them. Leadership that celebrates knowledge hoarding as loyalty rather than treating it as a system failure. Teams that create documentation but never make it discoverable or maintain it, so people hoard knowledge because documented alternatives don't work.

WattNext's knowledge management diagnostics examine whether tacit knowledge is actively being captured in decision contexts, whether knowledge-sharing practices are built into workflows, and whether organizations have mechanisms for ongoing capture rather than crisis documentation.
