# What causes the peanut butter spread of resources?

## Short Answer

Inability to say no + trying to do everything

## Why This Matters

The peanut butter spread happens when organizations can't say no. Every request seems legitimate. Every project sounds important. Every initiative could create value. So leadership tries to do everything, spreading resources thin across more priorities than can possibly be effectively pursued. Nobody gets enough attention. Everything moves slowly. Nothing gets truly great. The organization is busy but ineffective.

The fundamental problem is that saying no is hard. Saying no to a customer feels risky. Saying no to an internal initiative feels like stifling innovation. Saying no means accepting opportunity cost - this initiative doesn't get done, that team doesn't get resources. But not saying no means spreading resources so thin that everything gets mediocre effort, which is actually worse than a few things getting excellent effort and others being postponed.

Peanut butter spread is often rationalized with phrases like "we need to explore that," "let's give it a small team," or "we can start it while maintaining other work." But every small team still requires coordination, every exploration still takes time, and combining new work with existing commitments means existing commitments suffer. The spread is rarely visible because the cost is distributed - people working on more things, context switching more, deadline slipping gradually rather than suddenly.

**Managing resource allocation requires three discipline-based practices:**

First, establish explicit prioritization. Not vague strategic priorities - explicit ranking of what matters most. "Top 3" vs "important but backlog" vs "nice to have." This forces choices. You can't say yes to everything, so you have to choose. Leadership that refuses to make explicit priority choices is choosing peanut butter spread implicitly.

Second, protect allocated resources. When you decide something is important, commit actual resources. If it's top priority, it gets dedicated teams. If it's backlog, it waits. Don't try to work on top priorities and backlog simultaneously - that's just slow progress on everything. Once resources are allocated, protect them from constant reallocation to "urgent" items.

Third, create a real intake process with deliberate rejection. New initiatives should go through an intake process. "Here's the request, here's the value it could create, here's what it would require." Then explicitly decide: yes (and what gets deprioritized), no (and why), or backlog (and when it would be reconsidered). Document rejected initiatives. Some become backlog later when higher priorities complete. Some stay rejected because they were never as important as they seemed.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Leadership unable to choose priorities - trying to do everything. No mechanism for saying no to requests. New initiatives constantly pulled into active work. Resources allocated to so many things that nothing gets meaningful effort. "Urgent" items constantly disrupting priority work. No intake process - initiatives just start when someone decides they're important. No visibility into total allocation, so peanut butter spread is invisible until productivity crashes.

WattNext's resource diagnostics measure how many concurrent priorities exist, how resources are actually allocated, and whether organizations have mechanisms for managing prioritization and saying no.
