# Why don't people follow documented processes?

## Short Answer

Process doesn't match reality of work

## Why This Matters

When documented processes get consistently ignored, the usual response is to blame people - they're not following procedures, they're undisciplined, they don't care about standards. But the pattern is too consistent for individual behavior. People don't follow processes because the documented way doesn't match how work actually gets done. The process is slower than necessary. It requires information that isn't available when needed. It skips shortcut that exists because the formal process is unnecessarily complex. Or it requires steps that don't make sense in context.

Rational people in rational contexts follow processes that work better than alternatives. When people bypass a process, it's usually because the bypass works better. This is valuable data - the process doesn't match reality. Rather than punishing people for not following it, investigate why the documented way isn't working and fix the disconnect.

The deeper problem is that most processes are designed by people who don't do the work regularly. Leaders or architects create a process that looks logical on paper, but never watch how work actually happens. They miss the constraints people navigate. They don't see where the process breaks down. They don't understand the judgment calls people make constantly. When the process hits reality, it fails.

**Creating processes people actually follow requires three complementary approaches:**

First, design from observed reality, not from ideal theory. Spend time with people doing actual work. Watch what they do. Ask why they take certain steps. Understand the constraints they navigate. Design process around how work actually happens, not how you wish it happened. This ensures processes match reality from the start rather than drifting from it immediately.

Second, make the process simpler than the workaround. If the documented way takes twice as long as the shortcut people have already discovered, people will keep using the shortcut. If the process is friction-free, people use it. This means minimizing steps, reducing approvals, making data entry easy, embedding process in tools so people can't skip steps accidentally. The path of least resistance should be the correct path.

Third, involve people who do the work in process design. They understand constraints you won't discover any other way. They can tell you what will work and what won't. Processes designed with practitioner input are far more likely to be followed because people see themselves in the design.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Processes designed by people who don't do the work. No investigation of why people aren't following processes - just blame. Processes that are slower than workarounds. Processes that require information not available when needed. Enforcement without fixing - punishing people for not following processes that don't work. Changes to processes without explaining why - people don't understand the reasoning so they keep the old way. Process documentation that doesn't reflect how work happens.

WattNext's process diagnostics examine how closely documented processes match observed workflow, whether processes are actually faster than alternatives, and whether practitioners were involved in process design.
