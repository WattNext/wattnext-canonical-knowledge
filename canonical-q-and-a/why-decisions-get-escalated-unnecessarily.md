Why do decisions get escalated unnecessarily?

### Short Answer

Decisions get escalated unnecessarily when **people fear making the wrong call more than they value moving fast**. This happens when: (1) decision rights are unclear so people don't know if they're empowered to decide, (2) previous decisions were second-guessed or overturned creating learned helplessness, (3) the culture punishes mistakes more than it rewards good judgment, and (4) unclear elevation criteria make people default to "safer" by escalating. The result: leadership bandwidth consumed by trivial decisions while actual strategic decisions don't get adequate attention.

### Why This Matters

Unnecessary escalation creates two problems:

**Problem 1: Leadership bottleneck**

CEO spends 45 minutes deciding which bug to fix. VP spends an hour on button color. Director reviews copy changes.

Leadership bandwidth - the scarcest resource in any organization - gets consumed by decisions that should happen three levels lower.

Meanwhile, strategic decisions that actually need leadership attention (market positioning, resource allocation, organizational design) get insufficient time.

**Problem 2: Organizational learned helplessness**

When people learn that decisions will be escalated or overturned, they stop trying to make good decisions. They just escalate everything and wait for leadership to decide.

This creates a vicious cycle:
- People escalate to avoid blame
- Leadership makes more decisions
- People learn that leadership makes decisions
- People escalate even more
- Decision-making capability atrophies throughout the organization

**Organizations with effective decision-making processes make decisions 50% faster than competitors** (McKinsey). But speed requires decisions happening at the right level, not everything escalating to the top.

### The Five Causes of Unnecessary Escalation

**Cause 1: Unclear Decision Rights**

**What it looks like:**

PM needs to decide whether to fix Bug A or Bug B. Both affect customers. PM isn't sure if this is their call.

Thinks: "Better safe than sorry. I'll escalate to Director."

Director isn't sure if bug prioritization is their decision or if it requires VP approval.

Thinks: "This affects customer experience. Better escalate."

VP pulls in CEO: "This is a customer-first decision."

CEO spends 45 minutes on bug prioritization.

**Why this happens:**

Nobody explicitly said: "Bug prioritization is PM's decision" or "Bug prioritization requires Director approval."

In the absence of clarity, people default to escalation because it feels safer.

**The fix:**

Explicit decision rights: "PM decides bug prioritization affecting <1,000 users. Director decides bugs affecting >1,000 users or requiring >1 sprint of work."

Now PM knows when to decide vs when to escalate. Unnecessary escalation disappears.

**Cause 2: Second-Guessing and Overturn Culture**

**What it looks like:**

Director makes decision: Prioritize Feature A over Feature B.

Week later, CEO sees Feature B on a competitor's roadmap. Overturns Director's decision: "We need to build Feature B immediately."

Director learns: "My decisions get overturned. Safer to escalate."

Next time similar decision arises, Director escalates instead of deciding.

**Why this happens:**

Leadership doesn't distinguish between:
- Bad decision process (didn't gather right information, didn't think it through)
- Bad decision outcome (decision was sound, circumstances changed)

When leadership overturns decisions or second-guesses without explaining why, people learn that their decision-making isn't trusted.

**The fix:**

When you disagree with a decision someone made within their decision rights:

Good response: "I see why you made this call. Here's information you didn't have [new data]. Given this, I think we should adjust. But the process was sound."

Bad response: "This was the wrong decision. We're doing B instead."

The first preserves decision-making capability. The second destroys it.

**Cause 3: Punishment for Mistakes Exceeds Reward for Good Judgment**

**What it looks like:**

Manager makes 10 decisions. Nine turn out well. One turns out poorly.

In 1:1, leader spends 45 minutes discussing the one that went wrong.

Manager learns: "Bad decisions get scrutinized. Good decisions go unnoticed. Safer to escalate and let someone else take the risk."

**Why this happens:**

Most organizations have clear consequences for bad decisions but no recognition for good judgment.

People rationally optimize for avoiding blame, not for developing decision-making capability.

**The fix:**

Explicitly recognize good decision-making:
- "You made a tough call with incomplete information. Here's why I think you used good judgment even though the outcome wasn't what we hoped."
- "That was the right decision based on what we knew. The fact that circumstances changed doesn't mean the decision was wrong."

When good judgment gets recognized more than mistakes get punished, people develop confidence to make decisions instead of escalating everything.

**Cause 4: Unclear Elevation Criteria**

**What it looks like:**

Manager faces decision: Change team's sprint planning process.

Thinks: "Is this my call? Or should I ask Director? Or does this require VP approval?"

No clear criteria for what requires escalation.

Defaults to: "Better escalate. Safer that way."

**Why this happens:**

Organizations define decision rights ("Manager owns team process decisions") but don't define elevation criteria ("When does a process decision require escalation?").

**The fix:**

Explicit elevation criteria based on:
- Reversibility: Can this be easily undone? If yes, decide. If no, escalate.
- Impact radius: How many people affected? <10: decide. >10: escalate.
- Strategic alignment: Is this clearly within current strategy? If yes, decide. If uncertain, escalate.

Example: "Team process changes: If reversible and affecting only your team, Manager decides. If irreversible or affecting multiple teams, escalate to Director."

**Cause 5: Absence of Explicit Empowerment**

**What it looks like:**

Director thinks: "I'm empowered to make decisions within my function."

Makes decision to deprecate feature affecting 20% of customers.

VP finds out after the fact. Furious: "Why didn't you escalate this?"

Director: "I thought I was empowered to make product decisions."

VP: "Not decisions that affect 20% of our customers!"

**Why this happens:**

"Empowerment" is communicated as a general principle ("I trust you to make decisions") without defining boundaries.

People interpret empowerment differently. Some under-escalate, making decisions beyond their scope. Some over-escalate, making no decisions without approval.

**The fix:**

Define empowerment with boundaries:

"You're empowered to make decisions on [specific types of decisions] as long as:
- Impact is limited to [scope]
- Decision is reversible OR
- Decision is irreversible but you've gathered input from [specific stakeholders]

If decision falls outside these boundaries, escalate."

### How to Reduce Unnecessary Escalation

**Step 1: Make decision rights explicit**

For every recurring decision type, clarify who decides and what requires escalation.

**Step 2: Define elevation criteria**

Establish clear criteria for when to escalate:
- Reversibility threshold
- Impact threshold
- Strategic certainty threshold

**Step 3: Support decisions instead of second-guessing them**

When someone makes a decision within their rights and it goes wrong, distinguish between bad process and bad outcome.

**Step 4: Recognize good judgment**

Make good decision-making visible and valued, not just mistakes.

**Step 5: Create decision-making learning loops**

After decisions (good or bad outcomes), review:
- Was this decision made at the right level?
- Did the decision-maker have the right information?
- What would improve decision quality next time?

Focus on improving the system, not punishing individuals.
