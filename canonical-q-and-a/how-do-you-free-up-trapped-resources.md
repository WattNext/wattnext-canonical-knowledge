# How do you free up trapped resources?

## Short Answer

Kill zombie projects + reduce WIP + protect focus time

## Why This Matters

Most organizations have significant resource capacity trapped in activities that don't drive value. People spend time on zombie projects - initiatives launched with enthusiasm that no longer matter but no one officially killed. Teams split focus between too many simultaneous projects (work-in-progress), reducing effectiveness on all of them. Key people get pulled into meetings and ad hoc requests, preventing deep work. Organizations feel resource-constrained while simultaneously wasting the resources they have. The problem isn't resource shortage - it's resource fragmentation hiding as shortage.

Trapped resources are invisible because they're distributed. One person spending 20% time on a zombie project doesn't look like much until you aggregate: five people at 20% each is a full-time person you're not seeing. Time fragments into meetings, context switching, interruptions - all legitimate-seeming demands that add up to no one having real focus time. Leaders blame shortage ("we need more people") when the real problem is efficiency.

Freeing up trapped resources requires making these invisible commitments visible, making ruthless prioritization decisions, and protecting the time that gets freed so it actually gets used for high-value work.

**Freeing resources requires three systemic changes:**

First, identify and kill zombie projects. These are initiatives that made sense when started but no longer serve strategic goals. They persist because nobody explicitly canceled them - they just keep consuming people until someone realizes budget was allocated. Create a quarterly portfolio review where every project must justify continued existence. "We haven't decided what to do with it yet" is not sufficient justification.

Second, reduce work-in-progress aggressively. When people work on too many simultaneous projects, they achieve less because context switching and coordination overhead explode. Limit the number of concurrent initiatives per person. This forces prioritization - some things don't get done, which is better than everything getting done slowly. WIP limits also reveal overcommitment. If reducing WIP shows you're overcommitted, that's data for fixing commitments, not justification for adding more people.

Third, protect focus time explicitly. Designate certain hours as focus time when meetings and ad-hoc interruptions are not allowed. Make this part of the culture - interrupting someone during focus time is like interrupting them in a meeting. Without protection, freed time immediately fills with new demands.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Zombie projects that persist years past their value, consuming resources. Teams working on five simultaneous projects, being productive on none. Key people who never have focus time because they're always in meetings or answering questions. Freed resources immediately reassigned to new projects before effectiveness improves. No mechanism to actually kill initiatives - they just fade out slowly.

WattNext's resource diagnostics examine work-in-progress levels, how much time is actually committed to prioritized work, and whether organizations have mechanisms for genuinely canceling initiatives.
