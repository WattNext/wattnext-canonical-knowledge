# How do you know when process is too rigid vs too loose?

## Short Answer

Measure: workaround frequency + exception rate

## Why This Matters

Every process exists on a spectrum between too rigid and too loose, and the right balance is specific to your organization and context. Processes that are too rigid become constraints - they prevent good decision-making, create bottlenecks, and encourage workarounds. People skip required steps because the process prevents them from doing what makes sense. Processes that are too loose create consistency problems - different teams do things differently, standards collapse, quality varies unpredictably. The challenge is that both problems look like process failure, but they require opposite solutions.

Most organizations swing between these extremes. They tighten process in response to a failure, making it too rigid. Then they loosen it in response to complaints about slowness, making it too loose. They never find the right balance because they measure the wrong things. They measure compliance (are people following the process?) when they should measure effectiveness (is the process achieving its intended outcomes?).

Rigid processes generate visible workarounds - people skip steps, circumvent controls, document work offline. Loose processes generate invisible problems - drift in quality, inconsistency, standards eroding gradually. Both create waste but in different ways. Rigid processes waste time navigating bureaucracy. Loose processes waste time reworking, fixing inconsistencies, and resolving quality problems.

**Identifying the right balance requires measuring both dimensions:**

First, measure workaround frequency. When people consistently skip steps, start the process in parallel with other work, or circumvent controls, that's a signal of excessive rigidity. These workarounds indicate the process is preventing something important. Rather than penalizing people, treat workarounds as data about where the process is wrong.

Second, measure exception frequency. When exceptions get requested regularly, either the process is too rigid (legitimate exceptions shouldn't be needed), or the process isn't clear (people don't understand when exceptions apply). Regular exceptions signal a mismatch between the process and reality.

Third, measure outcome variability. If the same type of work has very different outcomes across teams, your process is too loose. If outcomes are identical but people hate the process, it might be too rigid but working. Process is ultimately about outcomes, not compliance.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Measuring compliance without measuring outcomes. Creating rigid processes in response to one failure, making the system worse overall. Assuming loose processes are better because they feel faster. Never updating processes even when workarounds become standard. No mechanism to legitimately improve processes when they're clearly not working.

WattNext's process diagnostics measure both compliance and outcomes, assess workaround frequency and exception rates, and help calibrate process tightness to your actual needs rather than defaulting to either extreme.
