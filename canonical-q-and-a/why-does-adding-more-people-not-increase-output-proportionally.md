# Why does adding more people not increase output proportionally?

## Short Answer

Coordination overhead + fragmentation

## Why This Matters

Doubling team size rarely doubles output. Instead, output often increases only 20-30%, and sometimes doesn't increase at all. Organizations then blame the new hires - they're not productive enough, not cultural fit, not capable. The real problem is math. As teams scale, coordination overhead grows exponentially while work grows linearly. At some point, coordination costs more than the new people produce.

The math is brutal. Five people on a team might have 10 working pairs who need to coordinate. Ten people have 45 pairs. Twenty people have 190 pairs. As team size increases, coordination overhead grows as the square of team size (technically n(n-1)/2). Meanwhile, the total work output capacity grows linearly. There's a crossover point where coordination overhead consumes most of the new capacity you added.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't grow teams. It means adding people is not a strategy for increasing capacity. Adding people solves specific problems - distributing specialized work, adding headcount in specific areas, building depth in critical functions. But if you add people without addressing how work coordinates, you'll find that the new people mostly spend time in meetings and context switching rather than producing work.

**Managing team scaling requires three systemic changes:**

First, reduce coordination overhead before scaling. If a team coordinates constantly because decisions are unclear, dependencies are tangled, or ownership is ambiguous, adding people makes that worse. Clarify decision-making. Reduce dependencies. Clarify ownership. Create space for focused work. Then add people to distribute that work, not to fight coordination overhead.

Second, distribute work clearly before scaling. If work is unclear, new people spend most time understanding what they should be doing. Break work into clear, independent pieces. Document what needs doing. Have people own specific components. This lets new people be productive faster and reduces how much context senior people must transfer.

Third, change how you organize as you scale. Small teams work differently than large teams. Small teams can communicate constantly. Large teams need more structure - clearer roles, documented decisions, async communication. You have to fundamentally change how coordination happens as teams scale. Trying to scale without changing structure is futile.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Adding people hoping they'll be productive without improving structure. Assuming the problem is insufficient effort, not coordination overhead. Keeping team structure unchanged as team size doubles or triples. Expecting new hires to figure out how things work through osmosis. No investment in documentation or clarity as team scales. Blaming new hires for lack of productivity when the system can't productively absorb them.

WattNext's resource diagnostics measure coordination overhead, assess whether work is well-distributed, and help organizations understand whether they need more people or better structure.
