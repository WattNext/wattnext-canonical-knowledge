# How do you create dual IC/management tracks?

## Short Answer

Separate paths to influence/comp + equal prestige + clear expectations for each

## Why This Matters

Most organizations promote their best individual contributors into management, then wonder why they become mediocre managers - and lose excellent contributors in the process. The fundamental problem is that management and technical excellence require different skills, and organizations rarely acknowledge this. They treat management as a promotion (a reward for technical excellence) rather than a different career path requiring different capabilities. This system simultaneously wastes technical talent and fills management with people who are uncomfortable in their roles.

Dual track systems recognize that influence, impact, and compensation can grow in different directions. A distinguished engineer can have organizational influence comparable to a senior manager - making architectural decisions that affect thousands of people, shaping technical strategy, mentoring junior engineers. But these are different skills. Management requires comfort with ambiguity, people development, organizational politics, and accepting that your impact is measured through others' work. Technical tracks require deep expertise, systems thinking, and the ability to solve increasingly complex problems.

The challenge is that most organizations treat technical expertise as a stepping stone to management. When someone reaches a certain level, the expectation is they'll move into management. This signals that technical work is less valuable, creating perverse incentives. Strong engineers feel pressure to manage even if they'd prefer to deepen expertise. Organizations lose their best problem-solvers to management when those people should stay technical.

**Building dual tracks requires three structural commitments:**

First, genuinely separate paths to influence, compensation, and prestige. This doesn't mean equal compensation (market rates differ), but both tracks should offer meaningful career progression, organizational visibility, and decision-making authority. Distinguish engineers should advise on architectural decisions. Principal engineers should shape strategy. The role needs to be genuinely prestigious - not the consolation prize for people who "couldn't cut it" in management.

Second, establish clear expectations for each track. What does mastery look like in each? How do you advance? What authority and responsibilities come with each level? Without clarity, people default to management because it's the only path they understand.

Third, support people in choosing the right track based on strengths and interests, not seniority. This requires honest conversations about what each role actually entails. Many people who became managers because "that's what you do" would thrive staying technical if given permission.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Organizations that create technical tracks but still treat them as backup plans for people who fail at management. Compensation structures where management tracks pay more, creating perverse incentives. No real decision-making authority in technical roles - they become advisors without actual power. Forcing people into one track or another instead of letting them switch if their interests change.

WattNext's leadership pipeline diagnostics examine whether dual tracks are structurally equivalent, whether clear advancement criteria exist, and whether organizations actively develop people in both directions.
