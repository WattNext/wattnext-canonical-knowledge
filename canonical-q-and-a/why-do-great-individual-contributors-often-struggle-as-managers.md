# Why do great individual contributors often struggle as managers?

## Short Answer

Different skills + no training + identity hasn't shifted

## Why This Matters

The skills that make someone an excellent individual contributor are frequently the opposite of what makes someone an excellent manager. A great IC is often deeply focused on technical problems, solution quality, and personal achievement. A great manager must focus outward - on team capability, developing people, enabling others. A great IC solves problems themselves. A great manager helps others solve problems and makes space for others to develop. It's not just a promotion to a higher level - it's a fundamental shift in how you work and what you're measured on.

Organizations compound this problem by treating management as the natural next step for successful ICs. The brightest engineers get promoted into management. The sharpest analysts move to leadership. This creates two failures: you lose excellent ICs who would have been mediocre managers, and you promote people into management without preparing them. The system simultaneously demotes great individual contributors and underprepares them for their new roles.

The challenge is that this mismatch isn't obvious until someone actually tries managing. Many ICs don't realize until in the role that they hate it. By then it's too late - they've already changed roles, their IC team has been disrupted, and they're struggling as a manager. A much better approach is helping people understand the difference, exploring whether they actually want to manage, and developing them appropriately if they do.

**The core skill differences include:**

First, depth versus breadth. Great ICs often achieve excellence through deep focus and mastery. Great managers must breadth - understanding multiple domains, contexts, and perspectives. An IC can be brilliant in one area. A manager must understand strategy, team dynamics, organizational politics, people management, and the business broadly.

Second, maker versus multiplier mindset. Great ICs often measure themselves by what they personally create or achieve. Great managers measure themselves by what their team achieves. You literally stop doing the work you're good at and instead enable others to do work. This is psychologically very different and many ICs find it unsatisfying.

Third, ambiguity tolerance and political navigation. Individual work has clear definitions of success - your code works or doesn't, your analysis is right or wrong. Management has ambiguity and politics. People respond unpredictably. Decisions get made for political reasons, not logical ones. Some people thrive in this environment. Many ICs find it frustrating and demoralizing.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Promoting excellent ICs into management without assessing whether they want to manage. No training on management fundamentals before promoting. Expecting success without coaching during the transition. Valuing technical skill in managers more than management skill, reinforcing IC identity. Allowing excellent ICs who became bad managers to retreat to IC role - there's shame involved. Creating culture where management is the only way to advance and get recognition.

WattNext's leadership pipeline diagnostics assess whether organizations understand the skill differences between IC and management roles, whether people are assessed for management interest before promotion, and whether development happens before people step into management roles.
