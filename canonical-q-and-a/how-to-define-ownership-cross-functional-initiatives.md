How do you define ownership for cross-functional initiatives?

**Slug:** `how-to-define-ownership-cross-functional-initiatives`

**Short Answer:** Define ownership for cross-functional initiatives by **assigning one clear owner with decision authority while explicitly defining others' contribution roles**. Owner has final say and is accountable for outcome. Contributors provide required input, have specific deliverables, but don't have veto power. Handoffs between functions must be explicitly defined: who owns what until handoff, who owns after, what must be true for handoff to occur.
