How do you match authority with responsibility?

**Slug:** `how-to-match-authority-with-responsibility`

**Short Answer:** Match authority with responsibility by **ensuring whoever is accountable for an outcome has decision rights over the key inputs**. If PM is responsible for roadmap success, PM must have authority to prioritize features, allocate resources, and make trade-offs. Authority-responsibility mismatch creates learned helplessness where people are accountable but can't actually influence outcomes.
