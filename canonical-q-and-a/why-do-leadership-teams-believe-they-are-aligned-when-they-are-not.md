# **Why do leadership teams believe they are aligned when they are not?**

## **Short Answer**

Leadership teams often believe they are aligned because agreement at the level of intent is mistaken for alignment at the level of execution. Signal loss and silence mask how decisions are actually made and acted on across the organization. As a result, leaders converge on a shared narrative while operating under different assumptions and constraints.

## **What’s Really Happening**

Alignment is inferred from visible agreement in meetings, shared language in strategy documents, and the absence of overt conflict. However, alignment as defined here is observable only through consistent decisions and behaviors, not stated consensus.

As information moves upward, signal loss strips away context, trade-offs, and local constraints. At the same time, silence suppresses disagreement and unresolved tension at the source. Leaders therefore receive information that is coherent and reassuring, but incomplete. Each leader fills the remaining gaps using their own priorities, incentives, and interpretations, producing divergence beneath apparent agreement.

## **Common Misconceptions**

- If leaders agree on strategy, alignment exists
- Misalignment would be obvious through conflict or debate
- Clear communication prevents divergence
- Alignment is a shared mindset rather than a system condition

## **What This Looks Like in Real Organizations**

- Leaders use the same strategic language but make different trade-offs when decisions involve risk, cost, or timing
- Cross-functional decisions stall or require repeated escalation to resolve contradictions
- Teams receive inconsistent direction depending on which leader they engage with
- Execution outcomes vary despite apparent agreement at the top

## **Why Leaders Usually Miss This**

Leadership teams operate in environments where disagreement carries social and political cost. Signal loss reduces exposure to contradictory information, while silence limits the visibility of unresolved differences. Because leaders are aligned in intent and values, they rationally assume that alignment extends to execution. The system provides few reliable signals to challenge that assumption.

## **What to Do Next**

- Treat alignment as an observable system property, not a stated agreement
- Examine where decisions diverge under pressure, not where language converges
- Create conditions where conflicting signals can surface without penalty
- Separate diagnostic inquiry from corrective action
