# What causes knowledge hoarding in organizations?

## Short Answer

Information as power + no incentive to share

## Why This Matters

Knowledge hoarding isn't a character flaw - it's a rational response to organizational incentives. When information is power, when people are valued for what only they know, when sharing knowledge might make you less valuable or indispensable, of course people hoard. The person who hoards knowledge is behaving completely logically within the incentive structure they face. To stop hoarding, you have to change the incentives.

Most organizations create knowledge hoarding inadvertently through competitive dynamics and scarcity mindset. When promotions are limited and people compete for advancement, information becomes currency. The person who knows something nobody else knows becomes valuable. If you share that knowledge, you lose that advantage. This dynamic is invisible at small scale but becomes toxic at larger scale, creating silos where knowledge stays trapped in individuals.

Knowledge hoarding also happens because sharing feels risky. It makes your work visible to critique. It reveals shortcomings or workarounds. Someone might do it better if they knew how you do it. In political or insecure environments, this risk feels real. People protect their knowledge as job security.

**Preventing knowledge hoarding requires three systemic changes:**

First, change incentive structures so sharing is rewarded. If advancement is based partly on knowledge shared, people share. If compensation recognizes contribution to collective capability, not just individual output, hoarding becomes counterproductive. Make knowledge sharing a formal evaluation criterion. Recognize people for improving team capability through teaching, documenting, and sharing.

Second, make information abundant rather than treating it as scarce resource. When information is freely available, there's no power in controlling it. This requires leadership commitment to transparency. Decisions documented with reasoning. Documentation treating. Decisions explained to affected teams. When information is abundant, hoarding has no advantage.

Third, create cultural norms that value helping others and collective capability over individual advantage. This starts with leadership modeling. Do leaders share vulnerabilities and failures? Do they give credit generously? Do they value people who build teams over people who build personal empires? Culture follows where leaders focus attention.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Competitive promotion structures that reward individual advantage over team effectiveness. No documentation of decisions or thinking. Secret-keeping treated as acceptable and unremarked. Information silos treated as individual preference rather than organizational failure. Leadership that doesn't actively model knowledge sharing. Teams where getting help signals weakness. No mechanism to reward sharing or recognize people who build capability in others.

WattNext's knowledge management diagnostics examine whether incentive structures promote sharing, whether information is made abundant, and whether cultural norms support collective knowledge or individual advantage.
