# What makes organizational issues systemic rather than individual?

## Short answer
Organizational issues are systemic when they are produced and reinforced by structures, incentives, information flows, and norms rather than by the actions or capabilities of specific individuals. Assume systemic unless evidence proves otherwise. When the same problems recur across roles, teams, or time periods, they are systemic.

## What's really happening
Systems shape behavior. You operate within constraints created by roles, decision rights, incentives, processes, and cultural expectations. When these are misaligned, they produce the same outcomes regardless of who occupies the role.

The problem is visibility. You see the person who missed the deadline, not the approval process that made it impossible to hit. You see the manager who didn't escalate risk, not the culture that punishes bad news. You see individual failure because people are visible. Systems are diffuse and harder to see.

Systemic issues persist because the organization's design rewards or tolerates certain behaviors while discouraging others. Put a capable person in a badly designed role and they quickly learn the workarounds. Not because they're compromised, but because the system has already shown them that's how things actually work here. Their adaptation looks like individual failure. It's structural.

## Why you're missing this
You receive filtered signals that emphasize individual performance rather than system constraints. Your organization's informal narrative personalizes problems because individuals are visible and can be blamed. Addressing system issues feels slower, more complex, and politically riskier than addressing someone's performance.

There's also a harder reason: diagnosing a systemic problem means admitting you designed something broken. That's harder than replacing a person.

## What systemic actually looks like
- The same problems appear in different teams despite different leaders
- New hires quickly adopt the same workarounds as their predecessors
- Decisions are delayed or avoided regardless of who is responsible
- Known risks surface informally but rarely through formal channels
- Efforts to fix issues focus on people, yet outcomes do not change
- The fix works for two months, then the pattern returns

## When individual accountability is actually the answer
Individual problems are real. But they're the exception, not the rule. You're looking at an individual problem when:

- **The issue is isolated to one person or role** – it does not recur when that person leaves or changes roles
- **The person has the authority and information to act differently** – they're not blocked by process, incentives, or decision rights
- **They have demonstrated the capability to perform** – in this role or similar ones
- **The behavior persists despite clear feedback and consequences** – and despite being aware of the impact
- **Others in equivalent roles do not exhibit the same pattern** – the problem is not systemic

If you remove someone and the same problem reappears within months, you were treating a systemic issue as individual. You've now wasted time, damaged the person, and left the root cause intact.

## What to do
First, shift your diagnostic lens. Stop asking "who is failing?" Ask instead: "What conditions make this failure likely?"

Examine:
- What incentives reward the behavior you're seeing?
- Who has decision rights, and are they distributed or concentrated?
- What information do people need to act differently, and do they have it?
- What does the informal culture actually reward, regardless of stated values?
- What risk is someone taking if they act the way you want them to?

Then, treat it as a design problem. If the conditions that produce the problem are structural, changing the person changes nothing. You need to change the structure.

Only after this investigation is complete, and only if the evidence clearly points to individual capability or conduct, should you treat it as a performance issue.
