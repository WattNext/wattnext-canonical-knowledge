How do you translate vision into daily decisions?

### Short Answer

Translate vision into daily decisions by **adding strategic direction that makes trade-offs explicit and defines boundaries**. Vision alone ("become the platform of choice") doesn't tell people what to build or what to say no to. Strategic direction adds: target customer (50-500 employees), core use case (deal intelligence, not CRM replacement), differentiation (depth over breadth), go-to-market (product-led), and explicit trade-offs (AI insights over workflow automation). Now when Product considers features, Sales evaluates deals, or Marketing chooses conferences, the decision criteria are clear and shared.

### Why This Matters

**76% of employees say strategy isn't clearly communicated** (ClearPoint Strategy, 2024). But the real problem isn't communication - it's that vision statements don't contain enough operational specificity to guide decisions.

"Transform how teams collaborate" inspires but doesn't tell anyone whether to build Feature A or Feature B, target Segment X or Segment Y, prioritize Speed or Quality.

Without translation from aspiration to operation, every person interprets the vision through their own functional lens, creating drift.

### The Translation Framework

**Step 1: Start with Vision**

Vision answers: Where do we want to end up?

Example: "Become the AI-powered platform of choice for sales teams"

**Step 2: Define Customer Boundaries**

Who specifically do we serve? Who do we explicitly not serve?

- **Target:** Mid-market companies (50-500 employees), post-PMF, pre-scale
- **Not serving:** Enterprise (>500 employees), SMB (<50 employees), early-stage pre-revenue

**Operational impact:**
- Product: Don't build enterprise compliance features or SMB self-serve onboarding
- Sales: Don't pursue enterprise deals or SMB volume
- Marketing: Don't attend enterprise or SMB-focused conferences

**Step 3: Define Use Case Boundaries**

What problem do we solve? What related problems do we explicitly not solve?

- **Core use case:** Deal intelligence and pipeline health
- **Not solving:** CRM replacement, workflow automation, team collaboration

**Operational impact:**
- Product: Don't build contact management, email sequencing, or team chat
- Sales: Position as "makes your CRM smarter," not "replaces your CRM"
- Marketing: Content focuses on deal insights, not workflow efficiency

**Step 4: Define Differentiation**

What do we do better than anyone? What are we willing to do worse than competitors?

- **Differentiation:** Depth in sales insights, best-in-class AI for deal intelligence
- **Willing to be worse at:** Breadth across all revenue operations, workflow customization

**Operational impact:**
- Product: Say no to features that expand breadth, say yes to features that deepen insights
- Sales: Win deals on insight quality, not feature completeness
- Marketing: Position as specialist, not platform

**Step 5: Define Go-to-Market Model**

How do customers buy? How do we not sell?

- **GTM:** Product-led growth with sales-assist above $50K ACV
- **Not doing:** Enterprise field sales, channel partnerships, freemium forever

**Operational impact:**
- Product: Optimize for self-serve trial and activation
- Sales: Focus on product-qualified leads, not cold outbound
- Marketing: Drive trial starts, not just lead generation

**Step 6: Make Core Trade-Offs Explicit**

What are we prioritizing? What are we deprioritizing (even though it's valuable)?

- **Prioritizing:** AI insights over workflow automation
- **Prioritizing:** Fast iteration over feature completeness
- **Prioritizing:** Product-led over sales-led
- **Prioritizing:** Depth over breadth

**Operational impact:**

When Product considers building workflow automation feature:
- Vision alone: "Could help sales teams, aligns with vision"
- With trade-offs: "We prioritize insights over automation - no"

When Sales considers high-touch enterprise deal:
- Vision alone: "They want AI for sales, aligns with vision"
- With trade-offs: "We prioritize product-led over sales-led - no"

### The Decision-Making Test

Strategic direction is clear enough when it functions as a decision-making filter without requiring leadership approval.

**Test scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Feature Prioritization**

PM has capacity for one feature:
- Feature A: Deeper AI insights for deal risk scoring (core differentiation)
- Feature B: Workflow automation for follow-up tasks (breadth expansion)

**With vision alone:** Both could be justified as helping sales teams
**With strategic direction:** Feature A aligns (depth in insights), Feature B contradicts (breadth over depth) - choose A

**Scenario 2: Sales Opportunity**

Sales has two deals at risk of slipping:
- Deal A: $30K mid-market product-led, customer needs minor feature
- Deal B: $200K enterprise, needs custom development and services

**With vision alone:** Both are sales teams wanting AI platform
**With strategic direction:** Deal A aligns (mid-market, product-led), Deal B contradicts (enterprise, custom) - prioritize A, let B slip

**Scenario 3: Marketing Investment**

Marketing has budget for one conference:
- Conference A: Mid-market sales leaders, product-led focus
- Conference B: Enterprise CROs, solution-selling focus

**With vision alone:** Both are sales leadership events
**With strategic direction:** Conference A aligns (mid-market, product-led), Conference B contradicts (enterprise, solution-led) - attend A

### From Translation to Internalization

Translation alone isn't enough. Strategic direction must be internalized so it governs decisions automatically.

**Internalization tactics:**

**1. Repetition in Context**

Don't just communicate strategic direction once. Reinforce it in decision moments:

- PM proposes feature → Leader references strategic direction: "Remember, we prioritize depth over breadth"
- Sales asks about deal → Leader references strategic direction: "That's enterprise, we serve mid-market"

**2. Public Decisions as Teaching Moments**

When leadership makes trade-offs, narrate the reasoning:

"We're saying no to this $200K enterprise opportunity because we prioritize mid-market product-led over enterprise custom. This is strategic discipline, not leaving money on the table."

**3. Resource Alignment**

Ensure funding matches stated priorities:

If you say "depth in insights" but allocate equal resources to insights and workflow automation, people learn real strategy from resources, not statements.

**4. Hiring for Strategic Fit**

Hire people who have experience in your strategic direction:

If strategy is "product-led growth for mid-market," hire PM with PLG experience and sales rep with mid-market velocity experience - not enterprise solution engineer.

**5. Metrics Alignment**

Measure what matters to the strategy:

If strategy is "depth in insights," measure insight usage and impact - not feature breadth or total features shipped.

### Common Translation Failures

**Failure 1: Translating Vision into More Vision**

Original vision: "Platform of choice for sales teams"
Translation attempt: "Best-in-class solution for revenue organizations"

This is more aspirational language, not operational clarity. No decisions become clearer.

**Failure 2: Adding Constraints Without Priorities**

"We serve mid-market with AI-powered insights via product-led growth AND enterprise with customization via high-touch sales AND SMB with self-serve freemium."

This lists options but doesn't prioritize. Every trade-off still requires debate.

**Failure 3: Translating for One Function Only**

"For Product, this means build AI features for mid-market sales teams."

Without translating for Sales (which deals to pursue) and Marketing (which message to emphasize), Product builds in isolation and execution still diverges.

### The Litmus Test

Strategic direction is adequately translated when:

1. **New hires can describe your customer, differentiation, and what you say no to within 30 days**

2. **Five leaders from different functions make the same trade-off decisions independently**

3. **Resource allocation matches stated priorities without executive intervention**

4. **People can reject opportunities that contradict strategy without requiring approval**

When vision translates into decisions that align automatically, you have strategic direction.

When vision requires constant alignment meetings and executive arbitration, you have aspiration without translation.
