# How do you know if you have resource shortage vs resource fragmentation?

## Short Answer

Measure: % of resources on top priorities vs scattered

## Why This Matters

Most organizations misdiagnose their resource problem because they conflate shortage and fragmentation. When deadlines slip and work accumulates, the automatic response is "we need more people." But adding people to a fragmented system doesn't solve the problem - it adds to overhead without increasing effective capacity. Conversely, some organizations tolerate actual resource shortages because they assume fragmentation is the real problem. Understanding which problem you actually have is essential for choosing the right solution.

Resource shortage means you genuinely don't have enough people for the committed work, assuming that work is focused and well-organized. Resource fragmentation means your available people are spread too thin across too many priorities, projects, and interruptions - so they can't concentrate long enough to be effective. The symptoms look similar (missed deadlines, stressed teams, work backing up) but the solutions are completely different. Adding people fixes shortage. Consolidating priorities fixes fragmentation.

The diagnostic question is simple: what percentage of your available resource capacity is actually focused on your top priorities? If the answer is "we don't know," you almost certainly have fragmentation and haven't measured it.

**Measuring resource allocation versus fragmentation requires three data points:**

First, calculate what percentage of time available resources actually spend on top priorities. This means tracking where people actually spend time - in projects, meetings, support work, context switching. If your top three priorities claim only 40% of available time but represent 80% of stated business importance, you have fragmentation. This is usually invisible because the other 60% is spread across many legitimate-seeming requests.

Second, measure context switching and meeting time. High fragmentation organizations typically show people in five or more simultaneous projects, spending more than 50% of time in meetings, and having insufficient focus time. Fragmentation creates visible symptoms in how people describe their work: "I'm working on everything" versus "I'm focused on X and Y."

Third, identify work that shouldn't exist. Zombie projects, support functions that have grown beyond value delivered, processes that persist long past their usefulness - these are fragmentation disguised as work. Most organizations have 15-30% of resource capacity tied to work that, if eliminated, would simply free up time rather than hurt anything critical.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Organizations that solve fragmentation by adding people, which adds more meetings and coordination overhead. Assuming shortage without measuring actual allocation. Having top priorities that claim less than 50% of available resource time. No mechanism to actually reduce work or consolidate priorities. Good intentions about consolidation that never happen because individual requests seem reasonable.

WattNext's resource availability diagnostics quantify allocation to top priorities, measure fragmentation (meetings, context switching, WIP levels), and identify non-value work. We help distinguish whether you need more people or better prioritization - a distinction that determines whether your next hire solves or exacerbates your problems.
