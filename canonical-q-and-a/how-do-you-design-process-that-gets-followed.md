# How do you design process that gets followed?

## Short Answer

Start from how work actually happens, not how you wish it happened

## Why This Matters

Most organizational processes are ignored not because people are undisciplined, but because the documented process doesn't match how work actually gets done. A process designed in a meeting by people who don't do the work daily will inevitably miss reality. It might assume steps happen in order when actual work is chaotic. It might require information that isn't available when needed. It might skip shortcuts that exist because the formal process is too slow. When the documented way doesn't work, people create workarounds - and workarounds eventually replace the official process entirely.

The gap between documented and actual processes creates multiple problems. It makes the organization unable to enforce consistency because compliance becomes optional (the only way things can actually get done). It makes training ineffective because new people learn the real process from experienced colleagues, not documentation. It makes scaling difficult because there's no reliable way to onboard people. It creates risk because nobody actually knows what's supposed to happen.

Designing processes that actually get followed requires starting from ethnographic observation - understanding how work really happens - not from how leaders wish it happened. This means watching people do the work, asking why they take certain steps, understanding the constraints they navigate, and building process around those realities.

**Building processes that get followed requires three complementary approaches:**

First, observe actual workflow before documenting anything. Spend time watching how experienced people do the work. What decisions do they make? When do they deviate from the standard approach? What workarounds do they use and why? This reveals whether the official process is the problem.

Second, co-design with the people doing the work, not just leaders. They understand constraints - the tools that are actually available, the timing that actually works, the information bottlenecks. A process designed by practitioners tends to match reality much better. It also creates buy-in because people see themselves in the design.

Third, embed process into workflow rather than expecting people to follow separate documentation. If approvals are required, make them automatic in the tool. If certain information must be captured, make it a required field. Make following the process the path of least resistance.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Leadership designing detailed processes without understanding actual work constraints. Creating processes that require information not available when needed. Processes that are slower than the workarounds people already use. Expecting compliance without making the process easier than alternatives. Documentation that's never updated when reality changes.

WattNext's process diagnostics assess whether documented processes match observed workflow, whether practitioners were involved in design, and whether the process is embedded in tools and systems rather than relying on voluntary compliance.
