# Why do teams repeat the same crises?

## Short Answer

Fix symptom not cause + no learning loop + no ownership of prevention

## Why This Matters

Most organizations repeat crises not because they're incompetent but because they treat crises as events to survive rather than as data to learn from. When a crisis ends, the energy dissipates. People move on to other work. Whoever led the response might leave or get reassigned. The knowledge about what went wrong rarely gets converted into systemic changes. So when similar conditions appear, the same crisis happens again. And again. Until finally something forces attention.

This happens because crises feel like aberrations - unusual events that won't recur - rather than what they usually are: predictable failures given your current systems. If a crisis happened once, conditions that caused it still exist. Prevent those conditions from reoccurring and the crisis won't repeat. But this requires converting crisis into learning, and extracting learning from crisis is effortful.

Many organizations go through crises, blame individuals ("that person made a mistake"), make personal changes, and declare victory. But if the systemic conditions that enabled the crisis are still in place, the next person in that role will make a similar mistake. Crises repeat because organizations fix symptoms (person changes) not causes (systemic conditions).

**Preventing crisis repetition requires three systemic practices:**

First, establish real ownership of crisis prevention. Someone needs to be genuinely responsible for ensuring the same crisis doesn't recur. This can't be nobody. It can't be the person who's already busy with their day job. It needs to be explicit ownership. Someone who's accountable for analyzing what happened, identifying what systemic changes would prevent recurrence, and driving those changes. Without ownership, prevention doesn't happen.

Second, establish learning practices after crises. Conduct real post-mortems - not blame-focused but cause-focused. What systemic conditions enabled this crisis? What warning signs existed that were missed? What process changes would prevent this? If it was a person making a mistake, what systemic change would make that mistake less likely? Document findings. Actually implement changes.

Third, fix root causes, not just the immediate problem. When a crisis happens, there's pressure to fix it fast and move on. But taking time to identify root causes prevents future crises. Someone skipped a critical step? Why was that step skippable? What made it acceptable to skip? Can you make the step non-skippable? Fix that, not just the person.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Blaming individuals for crises when systems enabled them. Going through motions of post-mortems without identifying systemic changes. Post-mortems that document but don't result in action. Changes that address immediate problem but not root cause. High-risk conditions left in place because they "won't happen again." Crisis response teams disbanded or dispersed after each crisis. No ongoing responsibility for prevention.

WattNext's operational resilience diagnostics examine whether organizations establish learning loops from crises, whether root causes get addressed, and whether similar crises recur - a clear signal of prevention failures.
