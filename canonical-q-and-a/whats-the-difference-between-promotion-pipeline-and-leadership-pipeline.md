# What's the difference between promotion pipeline and leadership pipeline?

## Short Answer

Promotion = reward for past performance, leadership = preparation for future role

## Why This Matters

Most organizations confuse these two very different concepts and end up with poor outcomes in both. A promotion pipeline treats advancement as a reward for past performance - you did well in your current role, so we promote you. A leadership pipeline treats advancement as investment in future capability - we're developing people to lead well in future roles. These are fundamentally different approaches with different goals and different failure modes.

Promotion-focused approaches reward the wrong behaviors. They treat advancement as scarce and competitive, encouraging people to make themselves look good while others look bad. They promote based on past performance, which doesn't predict management success. They skip the development part - just move someone up and hope they figure out the new role. This system works fine until the person gets promoted to where incompetence becomes visible and expensive.

Leadership pipeline approaches invest in developing people. They acknowledge that leadership requires different skills than individual contribution. They develop people progressively through multiple roles. They assess readiness rather than rewarding seniority. They create multiple paths to leadership and impact. This approach takes longer and requires more investment, but produces better leaders and healthier organizations.

**The differences manifest across multiple dimensions:**

First, advancement criteria. Promotion asks "are you good at your current job?" Leadership development asks "do you have or can you develop the capabilities needed for future roles?" These are different questions. Someone might be excellent at their current role but not interested in management. Someone might be moderate at current role but have high leadership potential.

Second, development approach. Promotion requires no development - you advance based on current capability. Leadership development requires structured development - teaching, coaching, practice opportunities, feedback. It's slower but produces more capable leaders.

Third, pathways. Promotions assume one path - up through management layers. Leadership pipelines create multiple paths - management track, technical track, specialist track. Different people have different strengths and interests.

Fourth, timeline. Promotions are events - you get promoted. Leadership development spans years - gradually building capability, increasing scope and responsibility, developing judgment.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Using promotion as primary tool for retaining top talent, creating incentive to manage or leave. No development before promotion, then being surprised when new managers struggle. Treating management advancement as only path to prestige. Promoting the best current performer regardless of management interest or capability. No distinction between rewarding past performance and developing future capability. Advancing people too quickly because they're good at current role, without assessing leadership readiness.

WattNext's leadership pipeline diagnostics examine whether organizations distinguish between promotion and development, whether advancement criteria assess future capability, and whether development happens progressively before people step into new roles.
