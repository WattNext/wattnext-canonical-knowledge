# What's the difference between process compliance and process effectiveness?

## Short Answer

Compliance = following steps, effectiveness = achieving outcomes

## Why This Matters

Most organizations measure process compliance (are people following the steps?) without measuring process effectiveness (is the process achieving its intended outcomes?). This creates perverse incentives where people follow processes that don't work while measures that make things better get skipped because they're not in the process. A process that people follow perfectly might be achieving terrible results. A process with workarounds might be delivering great outcomes. You're measuring the wrong thing.

Compliance is easy to measure - did they fill out the form? Did they get approval? Did they follow the checklist? Effectiveness is harder - did this prevent the problem? Did this improve quality? Did this actually serve the customer? Because compliance is easier to measure, organizations often default to measuring it and then assume effectiveness follows. It doesn't.

Organizations create this trap by defining processes based on assumed causation rather than demonstrated cause. "If we require this approval, quality will improve." "If we document decisions, we'll avoid repeating mistakes." "If we follow this process, outcomes will improve." Assumptions often seem reasonable, but reality is more complex. The process might be preventing good decisions. It might be creating false comfort without actually improving outcomes. It might be slowing things down so much that delays cause worse problems than the process was meant to prevent.

**Distinguishing compliance from effectiveness requires measuring both dimensions:**

First, measure compliance where it matters. Some processes exist because of regulations or critical controls. These should be measured for compliance. But don't assume that everything that's hard to measure for compliance is still important. Make explicit what actually matters for compliance and what can be optional.

Second, measure outcomes the process is meant to achieve. If a process is about preventing customer problems, measure whether customer problems are decreasing. If it's about decision quality, measure whether decisions are better. If it's about speed, measure whether relevant work is faster. This connects process to actual impact.

Third, get feedback from people doing the work. They can tell you when processes create problems bigger than they solve. When people consistently work around a process, that's a signal. When they report that a process is slowing things down more than the problem it prevents, listen. Don't assume they're right, but do investigate.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Measuring compliance as proxy for effectiveness. Processes that people follow while delivering worse outcomes. No connection between process and measured results. People working around processes that are counterproductive but officially required. Processes that were designed to prevent something but that threat is no longer relevant. Assuming that rigid process compliance is how you get reliability.

WattNext's process diagnostics measure both compliance and outcomes, assess whether processes are achieving their stated goals, and help organizations distinguish between processes that matter and processes that are merely documented.
