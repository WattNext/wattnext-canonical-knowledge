# How do you make documentation findable?

## Short Answer

Consistent structure + good search + clear ownership

## Why This Matters

Most documentation goes unused not because it's bad but because people can't find it. Someone documents a critical procedure, but when the next person needs that knowledge, they ask a colleague instead of searching. The documentation still exists but might as well not - people don't know it's there. Undiscovered documentation eventually becomes unmaintained documentation. If nobody's finding it, nobody's updating it. If nobody's using it, it becomes outdated. Eventually the entire documentation library becomes a graveyard of stale information nobody trusts.

Findability failures happen for multiple reasons. Documentation might exist but scattered across different tools - some in wikis, some in shared drives, some in email attachments, some in people's heads. There might be no consistent naming or structure, so searching returns noise. Ownership might be unclear, so when documentation is obviously wrong, nobody knows who should fix it. The documentation might be hard to discover because there's no clear entry point - new people don't know where to start looking.

The challenge is that making documentation findable requires continuous work and organizational commitment. It's easier to write documentation once than to make it discoverable indefinitely. Findability requires structure, maintenance, search infrastructure, and cultural expectations about where knowledge lives.

**Making documentation findable requires three complementary systems:**

First, establish consistent structure across all documentation. Similar information should be organized the same way wherever it lives. This creates patterns people can intuitively follow. Think of it like a standard file system structure where people can predict where to look. Without consistency, the burden falls on search - people have to try multiple searches and formats before finding what they need.

Second, implement good search infrastructure. Structure alone isn't enough if people can't find things. This means search tools that work across your documentation systems, not separate searches for each platform. It means search that understands your terminology and returns relevant results. It means making search the primary way people find documentation, not a last resort when browsing fails.

Third, establish clear ownership and maintenance responsibility. Every piece of documentation should have someone responsible for keeping it current. When documentation is obviously wrong, that person should know they're responsible for fixing it. Without ownership, documentation decays because everyone assumes someone else will maintain it.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Documentation scattered across many tools with no consistent structure. Search that returns too much noise or too little signal. No clear ownership, so outdated documentation persists unchallenged. Documentation that's technically correct but uses terminology people wouldn't search for. Documentation that's hard to find because new people don't know it exists. Organizational growth where documentation isn't centralized as scale increases.

WattNext's knowledge management diagnostics assess whether documentation has consistent structure, whether search is functional and trusted, and whether ownership is clear. We help organizations transition from undiscovered to discoverable knowledge.
