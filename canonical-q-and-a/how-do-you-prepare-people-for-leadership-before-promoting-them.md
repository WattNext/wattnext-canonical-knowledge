# How do you prepare people for leadership before promoting them?

## Short Answer

Teach manager skills while still IC + give practice opportunities + assess readiness

## Why This Matters

Most organizations promote people into management, then wonder why they struggle in the first year. Leadership transition is treated as a binary flip - you were an individual contributor, now you're a manager - rather than a gradual capability development process. The new manager is suddenly responsible for hiring, performance management, strategic thinking, and organizational navigation without ever practicing these skills first. This system sets people up for failure and wastes the expertise they developed as individual contributors.

The challenge is that management skills are entirely different from technical expertise. Someone brilliant at solving technical problems might be terrible at handling conflicts, making strategic trade-offs, developing people, or navigating organizational politics. These aren't things you learn by reading a management book or attending a seminar. They require practice with feedback, ideally while still having the safety net of an existing role.

Organizations that successfully develop managers treat it as a multi-year pipeline. They identify people with management potential while they're still individual contributors, teach them management fundamentals, give them progressively larger leadership opportunities (leading projects, mentoring people, driving initiatives), and assess readiness before formal promotion. They acknowledge that management is a different career with different skill requirements.

**Effective pre-promotion preparation requires three reinforcing elements:**

First, teach management skills while people are still in individual contributor roles. This might be through formal training, coaching, or developmental assignments. The key is making it explicit and structured rather than expecting people to intuitively develop these skills. People should understand management concepts, conflict resolution, delegation, feedback, and strategy before they're responsible for these domains.

Second, provide practice opportunities in lower-risk contexts. Lead a cross-functional project. Mentor several junior people. Manage a small initiative's budget. Interview candidates. Coach peers. These experiences let someone practice management skills while they still have their IC role to fall back on. They learn what they're actually good at and what they need to develop.

Third, explicitly assess readiness before promotion. Don't promote someone into management hoping they'll figure it out. Assess whether they've developed the necessary skills, whether they actually want to manage (many good ICs prefer staying technical), and whether they're ready for the specific role. This assessment prevents expensive mistakes where talented people are promoted into roles where they'll struggle.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Treating management as a promotion rather than a different career path. Promoting the most senior IC into a management role without assessing management capability. Expecting new managers to succeed without coaching or support. No practice opportunities for potential leaders. Promoting people who don't actually want to manage. Expecting success when fundamental management skills aren't explicitly taught. Onboarding managers for the business without onboarding them for management itself.

WattNext's leadership pipeline diagnostics assess whether management capability is actively being developed, whether clear readiness criteria exist before promotion, and whether organizations have structured development paths for future leaders.
