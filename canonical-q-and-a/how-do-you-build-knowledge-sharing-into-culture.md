# How do you build knowledge sharing into culture?

## Short Answer

Recognize sharing + make easy + show impact

## Why This Matters

Most organizations treat knowledge sharing as something people should do because it's the right thing - a values statement rather than a systemic practice. Then they're surprised when knowledge stays trapped in individuals' heads, shared only when directly asked. The problem isn't that people are selfish. It's that knowledge sharing competes with everything else demanding their attention, and most organizational systems make hoarding easier than sharing.

Knowledge sharing becomes cultural when it's easier to share than not to, when sharing is recognized and valued, and when people see tangible evidence that sharing makes a difference. Without these conditions, knowledge sharing remains aspirational regardless of how many times leadership talks about collaboration and transparency.

The challenge is that asking people to document what they know feels like extra work - work that interrupts the "real" tasks they're measured on. Writing down tribal knowledge, explaining shortcuts, updating procedures - none of this shows up in performance metrics. Meanwhile, keeping knowledge private often feels safer. It makes individuals indispensable, creates job security, and avoids the vulnerability of having others critique your methods.

**Building knowledge sharing into culture requires three reinforcing elements:**

First, recognition systems that treat sharing as primary work, not extra credit. This means explicit rewards - in compensation, promotion criteria, and visible appreciation - for people who make knowledge accessible. Organizations that successfully embed knowledge sharing make it a formal evaluation criterion, not a nice-to-have. When sharing is measured and rewarded like any other contribution, behavior shifts.

Second, systems that make sharing genuinely easy. If documentation requires special tools, complex formatting, or navigating bureaucratic approval processes, it won't happen consistently. The friction must be minimal. This might mean simple wikis, voice-recorded explanations transcribed to text, or documentation templates that take five minutes to complete. The easier the path, the more knowledge flows.

Third, visible demonstration of impact - showing people how their shared knowledge helped others. When someone documents a workaround and three other teams benefit, tell that story. When a training resource prevents repeated questions, quantify the time saved. People continue behaviors when they see results. Abstract appeals to teamwork don't change behavior as effectively as concrete evidence that sharing mattered.

**Common failure patterns include:**

Organizations that celebrate knowledge sharing in principle but promote people who hoard information in practice, creating cynicism about stated values. Systems that make documentation time-consuming or require perfection, ensuring only the most committed (or compulsive) contributors participate. Leadership that asks for transparency while creating competitive dynamics where information becomes a weapon. Recognition programs that reward sharing but don't provide time to actually do it, forcing people to choose between sharing and meeting their other deadlines.

WattNext's knowledge management diagnostics examine whether knowledge sharing is structurally enabled or merely encouraged - because encouragement without infrastructure consistently fails. We assess whether sharing behaviors are measured and rewarded, whether documentation tools are frictionless, and whether teams can demonstrate how shared knowledge improved outcomes.
