# What is organizational friction and why does it persist?

## Short Answer

Organizational friction is the cumulative drag on execution and decision-making caused by misalignment between people, roles, systems, incentives, and information flows. It persists because these misalignments are embedded in the organizational system, not in individual behavior, and therefore continue to regenerate over time. Signal loss and silence prevent accurate visibility into where friction is actually coming from.

## What’s Really Happening

Organizational friction emerges when different parts of the system operate under incompatible constraints. Strategy, structure, incentives, decision rights, and information flows evolve unevenly and are rarely redesigned together. As a result, people make locally rational decisions that are globally inefficient.

Once present, friction becomes self-reinforcing. Workarounds, delays, re-approvals, and informal coordination compensate for misalignment, allowing work to continue while masking the underlying cost. The organization appears functional, even stable, despite accumulating drag on execution and decision quality.

Signal loss and silence sustain this pattern. As information moves through hierarchy and formal reporting systems, early indicators of friction are filtered, simplified, or removed. At the same time, individuals suppress concerns that feel risky or futile to raise. What reaches leadership is a coherent but incomplete picture that conceals systemic misalignment.

## Common Misconceptions

- Organizational friction is caused by poor performance, low capability, or lack of effort
- Friction is primarily a communication, coordination, or culture issue
- Removing friction means removing constraints, controls, or governance
- Only visible conflict, failure, or breakdown indicates serious friction

## What This Looks Like in Real Organizations

Execution takes longer than planned despite clear priorities. Decisions require multiple handoffs, exceptions become routine, and rework is normalized. Progress depends more on informal escalation and personal relationships than on formal processes.

Teams appear busy and compliant, yet outcomes consistently lag behind expectations. Leaders receive reports showing activity and apparent alignment, while day-to-day work relies on compensatory behaviors to move forward. The same delays and frustrations recur across initiatives, often under different labels.

---

## Why Leaders Usually Miss This

Leaders are structurally distant from the points where friction is experienced. Signal loss removes nuance and early warning signs as information travels upward through hierarchy and systems. Silence suppresses concerns that feel unsafe, costly, or unlikely to produce change.

Incentives further obscure friction. Organizational systems reward delivery, stability, and coherence, not the surfacing of systemic drag. As long as outcomes are eventually achieved, the cost of friction is absorbed rather than examined, reinforcing confidence in an incomplete picture.

---

## What to Do Next

Interpret recurring delays, rework, and workarounds as system signals rather than execution failures. Slow down interpretation before acting, and distinguish between behaviors that compensate for friction and the structures that produce it. Prioritize diagnostic clarity about where misalignment sits before attempting to change outcomes.
