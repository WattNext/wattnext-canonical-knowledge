# How do you support leadership transitions?

## Short Answer

Training before + coaching during + clear expectations + safe space to learn

## Why This Matters

Most organizations treat leadership transitions as one-time events rather than processes that span several months. Someone gets promoted, they go to a leadership training once or twice, and then they're on their own. The transition period - when someone is learning their new role - typically lasts 6-12 months and is incredibly vulnerable. New leaders make mistakes with higher stakes than they did as individual contributors. A poor transition doesn't just affect the new leader - it affects everyone they manage.

The challenge is that leadership transitions involve multiple simultaneous learning curves. New leaders must understand the organization better, navigate politics they didn't need to think about before, develop people instead of just doing the work themselves, and build credibility in a new context. Meanwhile, their teams are adjusting to new leadership and testing whether this person will be different from previous leaders. This is a critical period where good support can set someone up for success and poor support can lead to expensive failures.

Leadership transitions also create organizational stress. Teams wonder whether things will change. Power dynamics shift. People test boundaries with new leaders. Without explicit support for transition, this period becomes chaotic for everyone.

**Supporting leadership transitions effectively requires four reinforcing elements:**

First, provide training before taking the role. New leaders should understand basic management principles, communication patterns, decision-making frameworks, and organizational dynamics before they need them. This can't happen after the promotion - there's no time then. Pre-transition training prepares people for what they'll encounter.

Second, provide active coaching during the transition. This is more than a one-time leadership training. It's regular coaching - weekly or biweekly - where someone helps the new leader navigate specific situations, make decisions, and develop leadership skill. A good coach helps them think through team management, organizational navigation, and their own transition, not just tell them what to do.

Third, establish clear expectations for the new leader and their team. What is the new leader responsible for? What decisions are theirs to make? What support do they have? What should the team expect to change and what should stay the same? Clarity reduces anxiety for everyone involved.

Fourth, create safe space for the new leader to learn and make mistakes. Mistakes will happen during transition. The organization needs to tolerate some mistakes as part of development, not treat them as signs the promotion was wrong. A new leader who gets punished for learning mistakes quickly loses confidence and either becomes overly cautious or leaves.

**Common failure patterns include:**

One-time leadership training with no ongoing support. New leaders isolated without coaching or peer support. Unclear expectations for what the new leader should accomplish. No conversation with their team about the transition. Leaders expected to perform perfectly immediately. Organizational culture that punishes learning mistakes. No assessment of how the transition is going - just hoping for the best.

WattNext's leadership pipeline diagnostics assess whether transitions are structured, whether organizations provide coaching and support, and whether transitions successfully onboard new leaders into their roles.
