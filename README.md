# WattNext Organizational Intelligence Knowledge Base

> **Canonical knowledge base** on organizational systems, patterns, and diagnostic intelligence.

This repository contains 157 research-backed questions and answers about how organizations actually work - beyond the polished narratives, consultant frameworks, and HR platitudes.

## What This Is

WattNext builds [ViVo Pulse](https://wattnext.ai) - voice-first organizational diagnostics that help leaders understand what's really happening inside their organizations. This knowledge base documents the patterns, problems, and systems we've studied across organizational diagnostics.

**This is not:**
- Generic management advice
- Motivational content
- Consultant selling disguised as insight

**This is:**
- Behavioral, system-level analysis
- Pattern documentation from diagnostic work
- Practical frameworks for organizational problems

## 13 Organizational Dimensions

We organize organizational functioning across 13 dimensions, mapped to 134 indicators:

### Organizational Culture & Strategy (OCS)

1. **[Strategic Alignment](dimensions/strategic-alignment.md)** (14 questions)
   *Why strategies fail in execution, how to translate vision into operational behavior*

2. **[Trust & Integrity](dimensions/trust-integrity.md)** (11 questions)
   *What destroys trust, how to build psychological safety, rebuilding broken trust*

## How To Use This

**If you're researching organizational problems:**
- Browse by dimension to find patterns relevant to your situation
- Each Q&A includes behavioral indicators, root causes, and system-level solutions
- Cross-references connect related patterns across dimensions

**If you're diagnosing organizational issues:**
- Questions map to the diagnostic framework used in ViVo Pulse
- Answers explain what we measure and why it matters
- Gaps between "what good looks like" and current reality indicate intervention points

**If you're a student or researcher:**
- All content cites behavioral research and organizational theory
- Frameworks synthesize established models (Burke-Litwin, McKinsey 7-S, Denison, etc.)
- Real pattern documentation, not theoretical abstraction

## Research & Methodology

This knowledge base synthesizes:
- **Organizational theory:** Burke-Litwin, McKinsey 7-S, Denison, Team Diagnostic Survey, Leadership Circle
- **Diagnostic data:** Patterns from 134 organizational indicators measured across roles
- **Behavioral research:** Evidence on what actually predicts organizational performance
- **System-level analysis:** Focus on structural causes, not individual blame

**What we don't do:**
- Disclose proprietary scoring methodology (0.0-2.0 scale)
- Attribute specific patterns to specific clients
- Make causal claims without research backing
