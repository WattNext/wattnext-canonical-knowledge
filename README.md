# WattNext Canonical Knowledge Base

This repository contains WattNext's canonical knowledge base for organizational intelligence, designed for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).

## What This Repository Contains

This is our public-facing thought leadership content demonstrating expertise in organizational diagnosis, systems thinking, and leadership effectiveness - without revealing proprietary diagnostic methodology.

### Content Structure

## The Three Categories

Our diagnostic framework examines organizations across three interconnected layers:

### 1. [Organizational Culture & Strategy (OCS)](/categories/organizational-culture-strategy)
**The Foundation Layer** - Where strategy meets behavior, values meet reality, and trust enables everything else.

**4 Dimensions:**
- [Strategic Alignment](/dimensions/strategic-alignment) - Culture-strategy execution gaps
- [Trust and Integrity](/dimensions/trust-and-integrity) - Psychological safety and credibility
- [Organisational Culture](/dimensions/organisational-culture) - Implicit norms and behaviors
- [Vision and Strategic Direction](/dimensions/vision-and-strategic-direction) - Purpose and long-term clarity

### 2. [Leadership, Collaboration & Structure (LCS)](/categories/leadership-collaboration-structure)
**The Execution Layer** - Where structure enables or hinders work, decisions happen or stall, and collaboration flows or fractures.

**4 Dimensions:**
- [Decision-Making Quality](/dimensions/decision-making-quality) - Decision rights and frameworks
- [Cross-Team Collaboration](/dimensions/cross-team-collaboration) - Silos and collaboration friction
- [Role Clarity and Accountability](/dimensions/role-clarity-and-accountability) - Ownership structures
- [Support for Teams](/dimensions/support-for-teams) - Manager effectiveness and enablement

### 3. [Systems, Resourcing & Scalability (SRS)](/categories/systems-resourcing-scalability)
**The Infrastructure Layer** - Where processes scale or break, knowledge compounds or evaporates, and resilience protects or fails.

**5 Dimensions:**
- [Process Robustness](/dimensions/process-robustness) - Process debt and workflow efficiency
- [Knowledge Management](/dimensions/knowledge-management) - Documentation and knowledge sharing
- [Resource Availability](/dimensions/resource-availability) - Access to tools, budget, people
- [Operational Resilience](/dimensions/operational-resilience) - Crisis response and continuity
- [Leadership Pipeline](/dimensions/leadership-pipeline) - Succession and talent development

## Canonical Q&A Library

Our [canonical Q&A section](/canonical-q-and-a/) addresses the questions leaders, coaches, consultants, and investors ask about organizational effectiveness.

**Published (9):**
- Why do leadership teams believe they are aligned when they are not?
- What is organizational friction and why does it persist?
- How does signal loss occur as organizations scale?
- [and 6 more...]

**Coming soon (138 more)** covering:
- Alignment & execution challenges
- Culture & behavior dynamics
- Decision-making patterns
- Knowledge & systems
- Leadership development
- Organizational change
- Trust & psychological safety

## Content Philosophy

Every piece in this repository follows three principles:

1. **Reveal themes, protect specifics** - We demonstrate understanding without disclosing proprietary methodology
2. **Engaging narrative over academic dryness** - Complex ideas told through stories and examples
3. **Actionable insight over theoretical frameworks** - Content leaders can actually use

## For Website Integration
